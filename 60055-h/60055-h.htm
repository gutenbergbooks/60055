</div>
<p class='c008'>“Sam—come here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Mrs. Ranck’s voice, and sounded more
bitter and stringent than usual.</p>

<p class='c009'>I can easily recall the little room in which I
sat, poring over my next day’s lessons. It was
in one end of the attic of our modest cottage, and
the only room “done off” upstairs. The sloping
side walls, that followed the lines of the roof,
were bare except for the numerous pictures of
yachts and other sailing craft with which I had
plastered them from time to time. There was a
bed at one side and a small deal table at the other,
and over the little window was a shelf whereon
I kept my meager collection of books.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sam! Are you coming, or not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sigh I laid down my book, opened the
door, and descended the steep uncarpeted stairs
to the lower room. This was Mrs. Ranck’s living-room,
where she cooked our meals, laid the
table, and sat in her high-backed wooden rocker
to darn and mend. It was a big, square room,
which took up most of the space in the lower part
of the house, leaving only a place for a small
store-room at one end and the Captain’s room at
the other. At one side was the low, broad porch,
with a door and two windows opening onto it,
and at the other side, which was properly the back
of the cottage, a small wing had been built which
was occupied by the housekeeper as her sleeping
chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I entered the living-room in response to
Mrs. Ranck’s summons I was surprised to find a
stranger there, seated stiffly upon the edge of one
of the straight chairs and holding his hat in his
lap, where he grasped it tightly with two big,
red fists, as if afraid that it would get away. He
wore an old flannel shirt, open at the neck, and
a weather-beaten pea-jacket, and aside from these
trade-marks of his profession it was easy enough
to determine from his air and manner that he was
a sea-faring man.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was nothing remarkable about that,
for every one in our little sea-coast village of
Batteraft got a living from old ocean, in one way
or another; but what startled me was to find Mrs.
Ranck confronting the sailor with a white face
and a look of mingled terror and anxiety in her
small gray eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Aunt?” I asked, a sudden fear
striking to my heart as I looked from one to the
other in my perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman did not reply, at first, but continued
to stare wildly at the bowed head of the
sailor—bowed because he was embarrassed and
ill at ease. But when he chanced to raise a
rather appealing pair of eyes to her face she
nodded, and said briefly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, marm,” answered the man; but he
shifted uneasily in his seat, and seemed disinclined
to proceed further.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this began to make me very nervous.
Perhaps the man was a messenger—a bearer of
news. And if so his tale must have an evil complexion,
to judge by his manner and Mrs. Ranck’s
stern face. I felt like shrinking back, like running
away from some calamity that was about
to overtake me. But I did not run. Boy though
I was, and very inexperienced in the ways of
life, with its troubles and tribulations, I knew
that I must stay and hear all; and I braced myself
for the ordeal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me, please,” I said, and my voice was
so husky and low that I could scarce hear it myself.
“Tell me; is—is it about—my father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s about the Cap’n,” he said, looking
stolidly into Mrs. Ranck’s cold features, as if
striving to find in them some assistance. “I was
one as sailed with him las’ May aboard the
‘Saracen.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why are you here?” I cried, desperately,
although even as I spoke there flashed
across my mind a first realization of the horror
the answer was bound to convey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Cause the ‘Saracen’ foundered off Lucayas,”
said the sailor, with blunt deliberation, “an’ went
to the bottom, ’th all hands—all but me,
that is. I caught a spar an’ floated three days
an’ four nights, makin’ at last Andros Isle, where
a fisherman pulled me ashore more dead ’n alive.
That’s nigh three months agone, sir. I’ve had
fever sence—brain fever, they called it—so I
couldn’t bring the news afore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt my body swaying slightly, and wondered
if it would fall. Then I caught at a ray
of hope.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But my father, Captain Steele? Perhaps he,
also, floated ashore!” I gasped.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sailor shook his head, regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“None but me was saved alive, sir,” he answered,
in a solemn voice. “The tide cast up a
many o’ the ‘Saracen’ corpses, while I lay in the
fever; an’ the fisher folks give ’em a decent burial.
But they saved the trinkets as was found on the
dead men, an’ among ’em was Cap’n Steele’s
watch an’ ring. I kep’ ’em to bring to you. Here
they be,” he continued, simply, as he rose from his
chair to place a small chamois bag reverently
upon the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ranck pounced upon it and with trembling
fingers untied the string. Then she drew
forth my father’s well-known round silver watch
and the carbuncle ring he had worn upon his little
finger ever since I could remember.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a time no one spoke. I stared stupidly
at the sailor, noticing that the buttons on his pea-jacket
did not match and wondering if he always
sewed them on himself. Mrs. Ranck had fallen
back into her tall rocking-chair, where she
gyrated nervously back and forth, the left rocker
creaking as if it needed greasing. Why was
it that I could not burst into a flood of tears,
or wail, or shriek, or do anything to prove that
I realized myself suddenly bereft of the only
friend I had in all the world? There was an iron
band around my forehead, and another around
my chest. My brain was throbbing under one,
and my heart trying desperately to beat under the
other. Yet outwardly I must have appeared
calm enough, and the fact filled me with shame
and disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>An orphan, now, and alone in the world.
This father whom the angry seas had engulfed
was the only relative I had known since my sweet
little mother wearied of the world and sought
refuge in Heaven, years and years ago. And
while father sailed away on his stout ship the
“Saracen” I was left to the care of the hard working
but crabbed and cross old woman whom I
had come to call, through courtesy and convenience,
“Aunt,” although she was no relation
whatever to me. Now I was alone in the world.
Father, bluff and rugged, so strong and resourceful
that I had seldom entertained a fear for
his safety, was lying dead in the far away island
of Andros, and his boy must hereafter learn to
live without him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sailor, obviously uneasy at the effect of
his ill tidings, now rose to go; but at his motion
Mrs. Ranck seemed suddenly to recover the use
of her tongue, and sternly bade him resume his
seat. Then she plied him with questions concerning
the storm and the catastrophe that followed
it, and the man answered to the best of his
ability.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Steele was universally acknowledged
one of the best and most successful seamen Batteraft
had ever known. Through many years of
trading in foreign parts he had not only become
sole owner of the “Saracen,” but had amassed a
fortune which, it was freely stated in the town,
was enough to satisfy the desires of any man.
But this was merely guess-work on the part of his
neighbors, for when ashore the old sailor confided
his affairs to no one, unless it might have been to
Mrs. Ranck. For the housekeeper was a different
person when the Captain was ashore, recounting
her own virtues so persistently, and seeming so solicitous
for my comfort, that poor father stood
somewhat in awe of her exceptional nobility of
character. As soon as he had sailed she dropped
the mask, and was often unkind; but I never
minded this enough to worry him with complaints,
so he was unconscious of her true nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, my dear father had been so seldom at
home that I dreaded to cause him one moment’s
uneasiness. He was a reserved man, too, as is
the case with so many sailors, and since the death
of his dearly loved wife had passed but little of
his time ashore. I am sure he loved me, for he
always treated me with a rare tenderness; but he
never would listen to my entreaties to sail with
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sea’s no place for a lad that has a comfortable
home,” he used to reply, in his slow,
thoughtful way. “Keep to your studies, Sam,
my boy, and you’ll be a bigger man some day
than any seaman of us all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain’s brief visits home were the only
bright spots in my existence, and because I had
no one else to love I lavished upon my one parent
all the affection of which I was capable.
Therefore my present sudden bereavement was
so colossal and far reaching in its effects upon
my young life that it is no wonder the news staggered
me and curiously dulled my senses.</p>

<p class='c009'>Almost as if in a dream I heard Mrs. Ranck’s
fierce questions and the sailor’s reluctant answers.
And when he had told everything that he
knew about the matter he got upon his feet and
took my hands gently in both his big, calloused
ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m right sorry, lad, as ye’ve had this blow,”
he muttered, feelingly. “The Cap’n were a good
man an’ a kind master, an’ many’s a time I’ve
heard him tell of his boy Sam. I s’pose he’s left
ye provided with plenty o’ this world’s goods, for
he were a thrifty man and mostly in luck. But if
ye ever run aground, lad, or find ye need a friend
to cast a bowline, don’t ye forget that Ned Britton’ll
stand by ye through thick an’ thin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With this he wrung my hands until I winced
under the pressure, and then he nodded briefly to
Mrs. Ranck and hurried from the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The twilight had faded during the interview,
and the housekeeper had lit a tallow candle. As
Ned Britton’s footsteps died away the woman
bent forward to snuff the wick, and I noted a
grim and determined look upon her features that
was new to them. But her hands trembled somewhat,
in spite of her assumed calmness, and the
fact gave me a certain satisfaction. Her loss
could not be compared with mine, but the Captain’s
death was sure to bring about a change in
her fortunes, as well as my own.</p>

<p class='c009'>She resumed her regular rocking back and
forth, riveting her eyes the while upon my face.
I did not sit, but leaned against the table, trying
hard to think. And thus for a long time we regarded
each other in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally she cried out, sharply:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what are you a-goin’ to do now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In what way?” I asked, drearily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In every way. How are you goin’ to live,
fer one thing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, much the same as I am doing now,
I suppose,” said I, trying to rouse myself to attend
to what she was saying. “Father owned
this house, which is now mine; and I’m sure
there is considerable property besides, although
the ship is lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiddlesticks!” exclaimed Mrs. Ranck,
scornfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered what she meant by that, and
looked my question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father didn’t own a stick o’ this house,”
she cried, in a tone that was almost a scream.
“It’s mine, an’ the deed’s in my own name!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” I replied, “but father has often explained
that you merely held the deed in trust for
me, until I became of age. He turned it over to
you as a protection to me in case some accident
should happen to him. Many times he has told
me that this plan insured my having a home, no
matter what happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess you didn’t understand him,” she answered,
an evil flash in her eye. “The facts is,
this house were put into my name because the
Cap’n owed me money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve kep’ ye in food an’ clothes ever sence
ye was a baby. Do ye s’pose that don’t cost
money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I stared at her bewildered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t father furnish the money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a cent. He jest let it run on, as he did
my wages. An’ it counts up big, that a-way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the house isn’t mine, after all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not an inch of it. Not a stick ner a stone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to think what this would mean to me,
and what reason the woman could have for
claiming a right to my inheritance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once,” said I, musingly, “father told me
how he had brought you here to save you from
the poor-house, or starvation. He was sorry for
you, and gave you a home. That was while
mother was living. Afterwards, he said, he
trusted to your gratitude to take good care of
me, and to stand my friend in place of my dead
mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fiddlesticks!” she snapped, again. It was
the word she usually used to express contempt,
and it sounded very disagreeable coming from
her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Cap’n must ’a’ been a-dreamin’ when
he told you that stuff an’ nonsense,” she went on.
“I’ve treated ye like my own son; there’s no mistake
about that. But I did it for wages, accordin’
to agreement atween me an’ the Cap’n. An’
the wages wasn’t never paid. When they got
to be a big lump, he put the house in my name,
to secure me. An’ it’s mine—ev’ry stick of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>My head was aching, and I had to press my
hand to it to ease the pain. In the light of the
one flickering candle Mrs. Ranck’s hard face assumed
the expression of a triumphant demon,
and I drew back from it, shocked and repelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If what you say is true,” I said, listlessly,
“I would rather you take the old home to wipe
out the debt. Yet father surely told me it was
mine, and it isn’t like him to deceive me, or to
owe any one money. However, take it, Aunt, if
you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got it,” she answered; “an’ I mean to
keep it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall get along very well,” said I, thinking,
indeed, that nothing mattered much, now
father was gone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How will you live?” she enquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, there’s plenty besides the house,” I
replied. “In father’s room,” and I nodded my
head toward the door that was always kept locked
in the Captain’s absence, “there must be a great
many valuable things stored. The very last time
he was home he said that in case anything ever
happened to him I would find a little fortune in
his old sea-chest, alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May be,” rejoined the old woman, uneasily.
“I hope <i>that</i> story o’ his’n, at least, is true, for
your sake, Sam. I hain’t anything agin you;
but right is right. An’ the house don’t cover all
that’s comin’ to me, either. The Cap’n owed me
four hundred dollars, besides the house, for your
keep durin’ all these years; an’ that’ll have to be
paid afore you can honestly lay claim to a cent
o’ his property.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” I agreed, meekly enough, for all
this talk of money wearied me. “But there
should be much more than that in the chest,
alone, according to what father said.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s hope there is,” said she. “You go to
bed, now, for you’re clean done up, an’ no wonder.
In the mornin’ we’ll both look into the
Cap’n’s room, an’ see what’s there. I ain’t a-goin’
to take no mean advantage o’ you, Sam, you can
depend on’t. So go to bed. Sleep’s the best
cure-all fer troubles like yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This last was said in a more kindly tone,
and I was glad to take her at her word and creep
away to my little room in the attic.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />I FIND A RELATIVE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>It may have been hours that I sat at my little
table, overcome by the bitterness of my loss.
And for more hours I tossed restlessly upon my
hard bed, striving in vain for comfort. But suddenly,
as I recalled a little affectionate gesture
of my father’s, I burst into a flood of tears, and
oh, what a relief it was to be able to cry—to sob
away the load that had well-nigh overburdened
my young heart!</p>

<p class='c009'>After that last paroxysm of grief I fell asleep,
worn out by my own emotions, and it was long
past my usual hour for rising that I finally awoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment, as I lay staring at the bright
morning sunshine, the sorrow that had been forgotten
in sleep swept over me like a flood, and I
wept again at the thought of my utter loneliness
and the dreadful fate that had overtaken my dear
father. But presently, with the elasticity of
youth, I was enabled to control myself, and turn
my thoughts toward the future. Then I remembered
that Mrs. Ranck and I were to enter the
Captain’s locked room, and take an inventory of
his possessions, and I began hurriedly to dress
myself, that this sad duty might be accomplished
as soon as possible. The recollection of the
woman’s preposterous claims moved me to sullen
anger. It seemed like a reflection on father’s
honesty to claim that he had been in her debt all
these years, and I resolved that she should be
paid every penny she demanded, that the Captain’s
honor might remain untarnished in death,
even as it had ever been during his lifetime.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as I was ready I descended the stairs
to the living-room, where Mrs. Ranck sat rocking
in her chair, just as I had left her the night
before. She was always an early riser, and I noticed
that she had eaten her own breakfast and
left a piece of bacon and corn-bread for me upon
the hearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>She made no reply to my “good morning,
Aunt,” so I took the plate from the hearth and
ate my breakfast in silence. I was not at all
hungry; but I was young, and felt the need of
food. Not until I had finished did Mrs. Ranck
speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We may as well look into the Cap’n’s room,
an’ get it done with,” she said. “It’s only
nat’ral as I should want to know if I’m goin’ to
get the money back I’ve spent on your keepin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went to a drawer of a tall bureau and
drew out a small ivory box. Within this I knew
were the keys belonging to my father. Never
before had Mrs. Ranck dared to meddle with
them, for the Captain had always forbidden her
and everyone else to enter his room during his
absence. Even now, when he was dead, it seemed
like disobedience of his wishes for the woman to
seize the keys and march over to the door of the
sacred room. In a moment she had turned the
lock and thrown open the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Shy and half startled at our presumption, I
approached and peered over her shoulder. Occasionally,
indeed, I had had a glimpse of the interior
of this little place, half chamber and half
office; and, once or twice, when a little child, I
had entered it to seek my father. Now, as I
glanced within, it seemed to be in perfect
order; but it struck me as more bare and unfurnished
than I had ever seen it before. Father
must have secretly removed many of the boxes
that used to line the walls, for they were all gone
except his big sea-chest.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sight of the chest, however, reassured
me, for it was in this that he had told me to look
for my fortune, in case anything should happen
to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman at once walked over to the
chest, and taking a smaller key from the ivory
box, fitted it to the lock and threw back the lid
with a bang.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s your fortune!” she said, with a
sneer; “see if you can find it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I bent over the chest, gazing eagerly into its
depths. There was an old Bible in one end, and
a broken compass in the other. But that was all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Standing at one side, the woman looked into
my astonished face and laughed mockingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This was another o’ the Cap’n’s lies,” she
said. “He lied to you about ownin’ the house;
he lied to you about takin’ me out o’ charity; an’
he lied to you about the fortune in this chest. An
easy liar was Cap’n Steele, I must say!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I shrank back, looking into her exultant eyes
with horror in my own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare you say such things about my
father?” I cried, in anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare I?” she retorted; “why, because
they’re true, as you can see for yourself. Your
father’s deceived you, an’ he’s deceived me. I’ve
paid out over four hundred dollars for your keep,
thinkin’ there was enough in this room to pay
me back. An’ now I stand to lose every penny
of it, jest because I trusted to a lyin’ sea-captain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t lose a dollar!” I cried, indignantly,
while I struggled to keep back the tears of
disappointment and shame that rushed to my
eyes. “I’ll pay you every cent of the money, if
I live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at me curiously, with a half smile
upon her thin lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll work and earn it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pish! what can a boy like you earn? An’
what’s goin’ to happen while you’re earnin’ it?
One thing’s certain, Sam Steele; you can’t stay
here an’ live off’n a poor lone woman that’s lost
four hundred dollars by you already. You’ll
have to find another place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do that,” I said, promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can have three days to git out,” she
continued, pushing me out of the room and relocking
the door, although there was little reason
for that. “And you can take whatever
clothes you’ve got along with you. Nobody can
say that Jane Ranck ain’t acted like a Christian
to ye, even if she’s beat an’ defrauded out’n her
just rights. But if ye should happen to earn any
money, Sam, I hope you’ll remember what ye
owe me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will,” said I, coldly; and I meant it.</p>

<p class='c009'>To my surprise Mrs. Ranck gave a strange
chuckle, which was doubtless meant for a laugh—the
first I had ever known her to indulge in. It
fired my indignation to such a point that I cried
out: “Shame!” and seizing my cap I rushed
from the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cottage was built upon a small hill facing
the bay, and was fully a quarter of a mile distant
from the edge of the village of Batteraft. From
our gate the path led down hill through a little
group of trees and then split in twain, one branch
running down to the beach, where the shipping
lay, and the other crossing the meadows to the
village. Among the trees my father had built
a board bench, overlooking the bay, and here I
have known him to sit for hours, enjoying the
beauty of the view, while the leafy trees overhead
shaded him from the hot sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was toward this bench, a favorite resort of
mine because my father loved it, that I directed
my steps on leaving Mrs. Ranck. At the moment
I was dazed by the amazing discovery of my impoverished
condition, and this, following so suddenly
upon the loss of my father, nearly overwhelmed
me with despair. But I knew that
prompt action on my part was necessary, for the
woman had only given me three days grace, and
my pride would not suffer me to remain that long
in a home where my presence was declared a burden.
So I would sit beneath the trees and try to
decide where to go and what to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>But as I approached the place I found, to my
astonishment, that a man was already seated
upon the bench. He was doubtless a stranger in
Batteraft, for I had never seen him before, so that
I moderated my pace and approached him slowly,
thinking he might discover he was on private
grounds and take his leave.</p>

<p class='c009'>He paid no attention to me, being engaged in
whittling a stick with a big jack-knife. In appearance
he was short, thick-set, and of middle
age. His round face was lined in every direction
by deep wrinkles, and the scant hair that showed
upon his temples was thin and grey. He wore
a blue flannel shirt, with a black kerchief knotted
at the throat; but, aside from this, his dress was
that of an ordinary civilian; so that at first I was
unable to decide whether he was a sailor or a
landsman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief attraction in the stranger was the
expression of his face, which was remarkably
humorous. Although I was close by him, now,
he paid no attention to my presence, but as he
whittled away industriously he gave vent to several
half audible chuckles that seemed to indicate
that his thoughts were very amusing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was about to pass him and go down to the
beach, where I might find a solitary spot for my
musings, when the man turned his eyes up to
mine and gave a wink that seemed both mysterious
and confidential.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Sam, ain’t it?” he asked, with another
silent chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” I replied, resenting his familiarity
while I wondered how he should know me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cap’n Steele’s son, I’m guessin’?” he continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same, sir,” and I made a movement to
pass on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down, Sam; there’s no hurry,” and he
pointed to the bench beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I obeyed, wondering what he could want with
me. Half turning toward me, he gave another
of those curious winks and then suddenly turned
grave and resumed his whittling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I ask who you are, sir?” I enquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No harm in that,” he replied, with a smile
that lighted his wrinkled face most comically.
“No harm in the world. I’m Naboth Perkins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh,” said I, without much interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never heard that name before, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember your mother?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not very well, sir,” I answered, wondering
more and more. “I was little more than a baby
when she died, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” and he nodded, and gave an odd
sort of grunt. “Did you ever hear what her name
was, afore she married the Cap’n?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” I cried, suddenly enlightened. “It
was Mary Perkins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, my heart fluttering wildly, I turned an
intent and appealing gaze upon the little man
beside me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Naboth Perkins was seized with another of
those queer fits of silent merriment, and his
shoulders bobbed up and down until a cough
caught him, and for a time I feared he would
choke to death before he could control the convulsions.
But at last he recovered and wiped the
tears from his eyes with a brilliant red handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m your uncle, lad,” he said, as soon as he
could speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was news, indeed, but news that puzzled
me exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why have I never heard of you before?” I
asked, soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t ye?” he returned, with evident surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked the stick over carefully, and cut
another notch in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, for one thing,” he remarked, “I’ve
never been in these parts afore sence the day I
was born. Fer another thing, it stands to reason
you was too young to remember, even if Mary
had talked to ye about her only brother afore she
died an’ quit this ’ere sublunatic spear. An’, fer a
third an’ last reason, Cap’n Steele were a man
that had little to say about most things, so it’s
fair to s’pose he had less to say about his relations.
Eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it is as you say, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite likely. Yet it’s mighty funny the
Cap’n never let drop a word about me, good or
bad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you my father’s friend?” I asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s as may be,” said Mr. Perkins, evasively.
“Friends is all kinds, from acquaintances to
lovers. But the Cap’n an’ me wasn’t enemies, by
a long shot, an’ I’ve been his partner these ten
year back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His partner!” I echoed, astonished.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little man nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His partner,” he repeated, with much complacency.
“But our dealin’s together was all on
a strict business basis. We didn’t hobnob, ner
gossip, ner slap each other on the back. So as
fer saying we was exactly frends—w’y, I can’t
honestly do it, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand,” said I, accepting his explanation
in good faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came here at this time,” continued Mr. Perkins,
addressing his speech to the jack-knife,
which he held upon the palm of his hand, “to
see Cap’n Steele on an important business matter.
He had agreed to meet me. But I saw Ned
Britton at the tavern, las’ night, an’ heerd fer the
first time that the ‘Saracen’ had gone to Davy
Jones an’ took the Cap’n with her. So I come
up here to have a little talk with you, which is his
son and my own nevvy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you come up to the house?” I
enquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Perkins turned upon me his peculiar wink,
and his shoulders began to shake again, till I
feared more convulsions. But he suddenly
stopped short, and with abrupt gravity nodded
his head at me several times.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The woman!” he said, in a low voice. “I
jest can’t abide women. ’Specially when they’s
old an’ given to argument, as Ned Britton says
this one is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I sympathized with him, and said so. Whereat
my uncle gave me a look gentle and kindly,
and said in a friendly tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sam, my boy, I want to tell you all about
myself, that’s your blood uncle an’ no mistake;
but first I want you to tell me all about yourself.
You’re an orphan, now, an’ my dead sister’s
child, an’ I take it I’m the only real friend you’ve
got in the world. So now, fire away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was something about the personality of
Naboth Perkins that invited confidence; or perhaps
it was my loneliness and need of a friend
that led me to accept this astonishing uncle in
good faith. Anyway, I did not hesitate to tell him
my whole story, including my recent grief at the
news of my dear father’s death and the startling
discovery I had just made that I was penniless
and in debt for my living to Mrs. Ranck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Father has often told me,” I concluded, “that
the house was mine, and had been put in Mrs.
Ranck’s name because he felt she was honest, and
would guard my interests in his absence. And
he told me there was a store of valuable articles
in his room, which he had been accumulating for
years, and that the old sea-chest alone contained
enough to make me independent. But when we
examined the room this morning everything was
gone, and the chest was empty. I don’t know
what to think about it, I’m sure; for father never
lied, in spite of what Mrs. Ranck says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth whistled a sailor’s hornpipe in
a slow, jerky, and altogether dismal fashion.
When it was quite finished, even to the last quavering
bar, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sam, who kept the keys to the room, an’ the
chest?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Ranck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“M—m. Was the room dark, an’ all covered
over with dust, when you went in there this
mornin’?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I——I don’t think it was,” I answered, trying
to recollect. “No! I remember, now. The
blind was wide open, and the room looked clean
and in good order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sailors,” remarked Mr. Perkins, impressively,
“never is known to keep their rooms in good
order. The Cap’n been gone five months an’
more. If all was straight the dust would be thick
on everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure,” said I, very gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, Sam, it stands to reason the ol’ woman
went inter the room while you was asleep, an’
took out everything she could lay her hands on.
Cap’n Steele didn’t lie to you, my boy. But he
made the mistake of thinkin’ the woman honest.
She took advantage of the fact that the Cap’n
was dead, an’ couldn’t prove nothin’. And so
she robbed you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The suspicion had crossed my mind before,
and I was not greatly surprised to hear my uncle
voice it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, can’t we make her give it up?” I asked.
“If she has done such a wicked thing, it seems as
though we ought to accuse her of it, and make
her give me all that belongs to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth rose slowly from the bench,
settled his felt hat firmly upon his head, pulled
down his checkered vest, and assumed a most
determined bearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wait here,” he said, “an’ I’ll beard the
she-tiger in her den, an’ see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he gave a great sigh, and turning square
around, marched stiffly up the path that led to the
house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />MY FORTUNES IMPROVE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I awaited with as much patience as I could
muster the result of the venture. I was proud of
Uncle Naboth’s bravery, and hoped he would be
successful. Surely the brief interview with my
newly acquired relative had caused a great change
in my future prospects, for it was not likely that
my mother’s brother would desert me in my extremity.
I had left the house that was now no
longer my home without a single friend to whom
I could turn, and behold, here was a champion
waiting to espouse my cause! Mr. Perkins was
somewhat peculiar in his actions, it is true; but
he was my uncle and my dead father’s partner,
and already I was beginning to have faith in
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a full half hour before I saw him coming
back along the path; but now he no longer
strutted with proud determination. Instead, his
whole stout little body drooped despondently; his
hat was thrust back from his forehead, and upon
his deeply wrinkled face stood big drops of perspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sam,” said he, standing before me with a
rather sheepish air, “I were wrong, an’ I beg
your pardon. That woman ain’t no she-tiger. I
mis-stated the case. She’s a she-devil!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The words were laden with disgust and indignation.
Uncle Naboth drew out his gorgeous
handkerchief and wiped his face with it. Then
he dropped upon the bench and pushed his big
hands deep into his capacious pockets, with the
air of a man crushed and defeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she refused to give up the property?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give up? She’d die first. Why, Sam, the
critter tried to brain me with a gridiron! Almost,
my boy, you was an orphan agin. He who fights
an’ runs away may n’t get much credit for it, but
he’s a durned sight safer ner a dead man. The
Perkinses was allus a reckless crew; but sooner ’n
face that female agin I’d tackle a mad bull!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t the law help us?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The law!” cried Mr. Perkins, in a voice of
intense horror. “W’y, Sam, the law’s more to
be dreaded than a woman. It’s an invention of
the devil to keep poor mortals from becomin’
too happy in this ’ere vale o’ tears. My boy, if
ye ever has to choose between the law an’ a woman,
my advice is to commit suicide at once. It’s
quicker an’ less painful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the law stands for justice,” I protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the bluff it puts up,” said Uncle Naboth,
“but it ain’t so. An’ where’s your proof
agin Mrs. Ranck, anyhow? Cap’n Steele foolishly
put the house in her name. If she ain’t
honest enough to give it up, no one can take it
from her. An’ he kep’ secret about the fortune
that was left in his room, so we can’t describe
the things you’ve been robbed of. Altogether,
it’s jest a hopeless case. The she-devil has made
up her mind to inherit your fortune, an’ you can’t
help yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As I stared into the little man’s face the
tears came into my eyes and blurred my sight.
He thrust the red handkerchief into my hand, and
I quickly wiped away the traces of unmanly weakness.
And when I could see plainly again my
uncle was deeply involved in one of his fits of
silent merriment, and his shoulders were shaking
spasmodically. I waited for him to cough and
choke, which he proceeded to do before regaining
his gravity. The attack seemed to have done him
good, for he smiled at my disturbed expression
and laid a kindly hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run up to the house, my lad, an’ get your
bundle of clothes,” he said. “I’ll be here when
you get back. Don’t worry over what’s gone.
I’ll take care o’ you, hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave him a grateful glance and clasped his
big, horny hands in both my own.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, uncle,” said I; “I don’t know
what would have become of me if you had not
turned up just as you did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lucky; wasn’t it, Sam? But run along and
get your traps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I obeyed, walking slowly and thoughtfully
back to the house. When I tried to raise the
latch I found the door locked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Ranck!” I called. “Mrs. Ranck, let me
in, please. I’ve come for my clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer. I rattled the latch,
but all in vain. So I sat down upon the steps of
the porch, wondering what I should do. It was
a strange and unpleasant sensation, to find myself
suddenly barred from the house in which I
had been born and wherein I had lived all my
boyhood days. It was only my indignation
against this selfish and hard old woman that prevented
me from bursting into another flood of
tears, for my nerves were all unstrung by the
events of the past few hours. However, anger
held all other passion in check for the moment,
and I was about to force an entrance through the
side window, as I had done on several occasions
before, when the sash of the window in my own
attic room was pushed up and a bundle was projected
from it with such good aim that it would
have struck my head, had I not instinctively
dodged it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ranck’s head followed the bundle far
enough to cast a cruel and triumphant glance into
my upturned face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s your duds. Take ’em an’ go, you
ongrateful wretch!” she yelled. “An’ don’t ye
let me see your face again until you come to pay
me the money you owes for your keepin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, Mrs. Ranck,” I asked, meekly, “can
I have my father’s watch and ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, no!” she screamed, in a fury. “Do
ye want to rob me of everything? Ain’t you
satisfied to owe me four hundred dollars a’ready?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I——I’d like some keepsake of father’s,”
I persisted, well knowing this would be my last
chance to procure it. “You may keep the watch,
if you’ll give me the ring.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll keep ’m both,” she retorted. “You’ll get
nothin’ more out’n me, now or never!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then she slammed down the window, and refused
to answer by a word my further pleadings.
So finally I picked up the bundle and, feeling
miserable and sick at heart, followed the path
back to the little grove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It didn’t take you very long, but that’s all
the better,” said my uncle, shutting his clasp-knife
with a click and then standing up to brush
the chips from his lap. “We two ’ll go to the
tavern, an’ talk over our future plans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Silently I walked by the side of Naboth Perkins
until we came to the village. I knew everyone
in the little town, and several of the fishermen
and sailors met me with words of honest sympathy
for my loss. Captain Steele had been the
big man of Batteraft, beloved by all who knew
him despite his reserved nature, and these simple
villagers, rude and uneducated but kindly hearted,
felt that in his death they had lost a good friend
and a neighbor of whom they had always been
proud. Not one of them would have refused assistance
to Captain Steele’s only son; but they
were all very poor, and it was lucky for me that
Uncle Naboth had arrived so opportunely to befriend
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having ordered a substantial dinner of the
landlord of “The Rudder,” Mr. Perkins gravely
invited me to his private room for a conference,
and I climbed the rickety stairs in his wake.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chamber was very luxurious in my eyes,
with it’s rag carpet and high-posted bed, its
wash-stand and rocking-chair. I could not easily
withhold my deference to the man who was able
to hire it, and removing my cap I sat upon the
edge of the bed while Uncle Naboth took possession
of the rocking-chair and lighted a big briar
pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having settled himself comfortably by putting
his feet upon the sill of the open window, he remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Sam, my lad, we’ll talk it all over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, sir,” I replied, much impressed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place, I’m your father’s partner,
as I said afore. Some years ago the Cap’n found
he had more money ’n he could use in his own
business, an’ I’d saved up a bit myself, to match
it. So we put both together an’ bought a schooner
called the ‘Flipper’, w’ich I’m free to say is the
best boat, fer its size an’ kind, that ever sailed the
Pacific.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Pacific!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naterally. Cap’n Steele on the Atlantic, an’
Cap’n Perkins on the Pacific. In that way we
divided up the world between us.” He stopped
to wink, here, and began his silent chuckle; but
fortunately he remembered the importance of the
occasion and refrained from carrying it to the
choking stage. “I s’pose your father never said
naught to you about this deal o’ ours, any more ’n
he did to that she-bandit up at the house. An’
its lucky he didn’t, or the critter ’d be claimin’ the
‘Flipper’, too, an’ then you an’ I’d be out of a
job!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He winked again; solemnly, this time; and I
sat still and stared at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Howsomever, the ‘Flipper’ is still in statute
ko, an’ thank heaven fer that! I made sev’ral
voyages in her to Australy, that turned out fairly
profitably, an’ brought the Cap’n an’ me some
good bits o’ money. So last year we thought
we’d tackle the Japan trade, that seemed to be
lookin’ up. It looked down agin as soon as I
struck the pesky shores, an’ a month ago I returned
to ’Frisco a sadder an’ a wiser man. Not
that the losses was so great, Sam, you understand;
but the earnin’s wasn’t enough to buy a shoe-string.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I sailed cross-lots to Batteraft to consult
with my partner, which is Cap’n Steele, as to our
next voyage, an’ the rest o’ the story you know
as well as I do. Your father bein’ out o’ the firm,
from no fault o’ his’n, his son is his nateral successor.
So I take it that hereafter we’ll have to
consult together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My amazed expression amused him exceedingly,
but I found it impossible just then to utter
a single word. Uncle Naboth did not seem to expect
me to speak, for after lighting his pipe again
he continued, with an air of great complacency:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It mought be said that, as you’re a minor, I
stands as your rightful guardeen, an’ have a right
to act for you ’til you come of age. On the other
hand, you mought claim that, bein’ a partner, your
size an’ age don’t count, an’ you’ve a right to be
heard. Howsomever, we won’t go to law about
it, Sam. The law’s onreliable. Sometimes it’s
right, an’ mostly it’s wrong; but it ain’t never to
be trusted by an honest man. If you insist on
dictatin’ what this partnership’s goin’ to do, you’ll
probably run it on a rock in two jerks of a lamb’s
tail, for you haven’t got the experience old Cap’n
Steele had; but if you’re satisfied to let me take
the tiller, an’ steer you into harbor, why, I’ll accept
the job an’ do the best I can at it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uncle Naboth,” I replied, earnestly, “had
you not been an honest man I would never have
known you were my father’s partner, or that he
had any interest in your business. But you’ve
been more than honest. You’ve been kind to me;
and I am only too glad to trust you in every way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well spoke, lad!” cried Mr. Perkins, slapping
his knee delightedly. “It’s what I had a
right to expect in poor Mary’s boy. We’re sure
to get along, Sam, and even if I don’t make you
rich, you’ll never need a stout friend while your
Uncle Nabe is alive an’ kickin’!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we both stood up, and shook hands with
great solemnity, to seal the bargain. After which
my friend and protector returned to his rocker
and once more stretched his feet across the window
sill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much property belongs to me, Uncle?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We never drew up any papers. Cap’n Steele
knew as he could trust me, an’ so papers wa’n’t
necessary. He owned one-third interest in the
‘Flipper’, an’ supplied one half the money to carry
on the trade. That made it mighty hard to figure
out the profits, so we gen’ly lumped it, to save
brain-work. Of course your father’s been paid
all his earnin’s after each voyage was over, so
accounts is settled up to the Japan trip. Probably
the money I gave him was in the sea-chest, an’
that old she-pirate up to the house grabbed it with
the other things. The Japan voyage was a failure,
as I told you; but there’s about a thousand
dollars still comin’ to the Cap’n—which means
it’s comin’ to you, Sam—an’ the ship’s worth a
good ten thousand besides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to think what that meant to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t a very big sum of money, is it,
Uncle?” I asked, diffidently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That depends on how you look at it,” he answered.
“Big oaks from little acorns grow, you
know. If you leave the matter to me, I’ll try to
make that thousand sprout considerable, before
you come of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I’ll leave it to you,” said I. “And
I am very grateful for your kindness, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you turn your gratitude loose too
soon, Sam. I may land your fortunes high an’
dry on the rocks, afore I’ve got through with ’em.
But if I do it won’t be on purpose, an’ we’ll sink
or swim together. An’ now, that bein’ as good
as settled, the next thing to argy is what you’re
a-goin’ to do while I’m sailin’ the seas an’ making
money for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you suggest?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, some folks might think you ought to
have more schoolin’. How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sixteen, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you read an’ write, an’ do figgers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes; I’ve finished the public school
course,” I replied, smiling at the simple question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I guess you’ve had study enough, my
lad, and are ready to go to work. I never had
much schoolin’ myself, but I’ve managed to hold
my own in the world, in spite of the way letters
an’ figgers mix up when I look at ’em. Not but
what eddication is a good thing; but all eddication
don’t lay in schools. Rubbin’ against the
world is what polishes up a man, an’ the feller
that keeps his eyes open can learn somethin’ new
every day. To be open with you, Sam, I need you
pretty bad on the ‘Flipper’, to keep the books an’
look after the accounts, an’ do writin’ an’ spellin’
when letters has to be writ. On the last trip I
put in four days hard work, writin’ a letter that
was only three lines long. An’ I’m blamed if the
landsman I sent it to didn’t telegraph me for a
translation. So, if you’re willin’ to ship with the
firm of Perkins &amp; Steele, I’ll make you purser
an’ chief clerk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like that!” I answered, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the second p’int’s settled. There’s only
one more. The ‘Flipper’ is lyin’ in the harbor at
’Frisco. When shall we join her, lad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m ready now, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good. I’ve ordered a wagon to carry us
over to the railroad station at four o’clock, so
ye see I had a pretty good idea beforehand what
sort o’ stuff Mary’s boy was made of. Now let’s
go to dinner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />I SHIP ABOARD THE “FLIPPER.”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>When the two-seated spring wagon drew up
before the tavern door quite a crowd of idle villagers
assembled to see us off, and among them
I noticed my father’s old sailor, Ned Britton.
Uncle Naboth climbed aboard at once, but I
stayed to shake the hands held out to me and to
thank the Batteraft people for their hearty wishes
for my future prosperity. I think they were sorry
to see me go, and I know I felt a sudden pang of
regret at parting from the place where I had lived
so long and the simple villagers who had been my
friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>When at last I mounted to the rear seat of the
wagon and sat beside my uncle, I was astonished
to find Ned Britton established beside the driver.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going with us?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sailor nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s like this,” remarked Mr. Perkins, as
we rolled away from the tavern, “this man belonged
to my old partner, Cap’n Steele, an’ stuck
to his ship ’til she went down. Also he’s put
himself out to come here an’ tell us the news, and
it ain’t every sailor as’ll take the trouble to do
such a job. Therefore, Ned Britton bein’ at
present without a ship, I’ve asked him to take a
berth aboard the ‘Flipper.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was kind of you, Uncle,” I said, pleased
at this evidence of my relative’s kindly nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An honest sailor ain’t to be sneezed at,” continued
Uncle Naboth, with one of his quaint
winks. “If Ned Britton were faithful to the
‘Saracen’ he’ll be faithful to the ‘Flipper.’ An’
that’s the sort o’ man we want.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Britton doubtless overheard every word of
this eulogy, but he gazed stolidly ahead and paid
no attention to my uncle’s words of praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>We reached the railway station in ample time
for the train, and soon were whirling away on
our long journey into the golden West.</p>

<p class='c009'>No incident worthy of note occurred on our
way across the continent, although I might record
a bit of diplomacy on the part of Uncle Naboth
that illustrates the peculiar shrewdness I have
always found coupled with his native simplicity.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just before our train drew into Chicago,
where we were to change cars and spend the best
part of a day, my uncle slipped into my hand a
long, fat pocket-book, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hide that in your pocket, Sam, and button
it up tight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s your idea, Uncle Nabe?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, we’re comin’ to the wickedest city
in all the world, accordin’ to the preachers; an’
if it ain’t that, it’s bad enough, in all conscience.
There’s robbers an’ hold-up men by the thousands,
an’ if one of ’em got hold of me I’d be busted in
half a second. But none of ’em would think of
holdin’ up a boy like you; so the money’s safe in
your pocket, if you don’t go an’ lose it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll try not to do that, sir,” I returned; but
all during the day the possession of the big pocket-book
made me nervous and uneasy. I constantly
felt of my breast to see that the money was still
safe, and it is a wonder my actions did not betray
to some sly thief the fact that I was concealing
the combined wealth of our little party.</p>

<p class='c009'>No attempt was made to rob us, however,
either at Chicago or during the remainder of the
journey to the Pacific coast, and we arrived at our
destination safely and in good spirits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth seemed especially pleased to
reach San Francisco again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This car travellin’,” he said, “is good enough
for landsmen that don’t know of anything better;
but I’d rather spend a month at sea than a
night in one of them stuffy, dangerous cars, that
are likely to run off’n the track any minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ned Britton and I accompanied Mr. Perkins
to a modest but respectable lodging-house near
the bay, where we secured rooms and partook of
a hearty breakfast. Then we took a long walk,
and I got my first sight of the famous “Golden
Gate.” I was surprised at the great quantity of
shipping in the bay, and as I looked over the hundreds
of craft at anchor I wondered curiously
which was the “Flipper,” of which I was part
owner—the gallant ship whose praises Uncle Naboth
had sung so persistently ever since we left
Batteraft.</p>

<p class='c009'>After luncheon we hired a small boat, and
Ned Britton undertook to row us aboard the
“Flipper,” which had been hidden from our view
by a point of land. I own that after my uncle’s
glowing descriptions of her I expected to see a
most beautiful schooner, with lines even nobler
than those of the grand old “Saracen,” which had
been my father’s pride for so many years. So
my disappointment may be imagined when we
drew up to a grimy looking vessel of some six
hundred tons, with discolored sails, weather-worn
rigging and a glaring need of fresh paint.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ned Britton, however, rested on his oars,
studied the ship carefully, and then slowly nodded
his head in approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what d’ye think o’ her?” asked Uncle
Naboth, relapsing into one of his silent chuckles
at the expression of my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She looks rather dirty, sir,” I answered, honestly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ‘Flipper’ ain’t quite as fresh as a lily in
bloom, that’s a fact,” returned my uncle, in no
ways discomfited by my remark. “She wasn’t no
deebutantee when I bought her, an’ her clothes
has got old, and darned and patched, bein’ as we
haven’t been near to a Paris dressmaker. But
I’ve sailed in her these ten years past, Sam, an’
we’re both as sound as a dollar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She ought to be fast, sir,” remarked Britton,
critically.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Perkins laughed—not aloud, but in his
silent, distinctly humorous way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <i>is</i> fast, my lad, w’ich is a virtue in a ship
if it ain’t in a woman. And in some other ways,
besides, the ‘Flipper’ ain’t to be sneezed at. As
for her age, she’s too shy to tell it, but I guess it
entitles her to full respect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We now drew alongside, and climbed upon
the deck, where my uncle was greeted by a tall,
lank man who appeared to my curious eyes to be
a good example of a living skeleton. His clothes
covered his bones like bags, and so thin and drawn
was his face that his expression was one of constant
pain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morn’n’, Cap’n,” said Uncle Naboth, although
it was afternoon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Morn’n’, Mr. Perkins,” returned the other,
in a sad voice. “Glad to see you back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s my nevvy, Sam Steele, whose father
were part owner but got lost in a storm awhile
ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to see you, sir,” said the Captain, giving
my hand a melancholy shake.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ here’s Ned Britton, who once sailed with
Cap’n Steele,” continued my uncle. “He’ll sign
with us, Cap’n Gay, and I guess you’ll find him
A No. 1.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad to see you, Britton,” repeated the Captain,
in his dismal voice. If the lanky Captain
was as glad to see us all as his words indicated,
his expression fully contradicted the fact.</p>

<p class='c009'>Britton saluted and walked aft, where I noticed
several sailors squatting upon the deck in
careless attitudes. To my glance these seemed
as solemn and joyless as their Captain; but I acknowledge
that on this first visit everything about
the ship was a disappointment to me, perhaps
because I had had little experience with trading
vessels and my mind was stored with recollections
of the trim “Saracen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Below, however, was a comfortable cabin,
well fitted up, and Uncle Naboth showed me a
berth next to his own private room which was to
be my future home. The place was little more
than a closet, but I decided it would do very well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought <i>you</i> were the captain of the ‘Flipper,’
Uncle Naboth,” said I, when we were alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I’m jest super-cargo,” he replied, with
his usual wink. “You see, I wasn’t eddicated as
a sailor, Sam, an’ never cared to learn the trade.
Cap’n Gay is one o’ the best seamen that ever
laid a course, so I hire him to take the ship where-ever
I want to go. As fer the cargo, that’s my
’special look-out, an’ it keeps me busy enough, I
can tell you. I’m a nat’ral born trader, and except
fer that blamed Japan trip, I ain’t much
ashamed of my record.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you go to Australia again?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not jest now, Sam. My next venture’s
goin’ to be a bit irregular—what you might call
speculative, an’ extry-hazardous. But we’ll talk
that over tonight, after supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After making a cursory examination of the
ship Uncle Naboth received the Captain’s report
of what had transpired in his absence, and then
we rowed back to town again.</p>

<p class='c009'>We strolled through the city streets for an
hour, had supper, and then my uncle took me to
his room, carefully closed and locked the door,
and announced that he was ready to “talk business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bein’ partners,” he said, “we’ve got to consult
together; but I take it you won’t feel bad,
Sam, if I do most of the consultin’. I went down
East to Batteraft to talk my plans with your
father, but he slipped his cable an’ I’ve got to
talk ’em to you. If you see I’m wrong, anywhere,
jest chip in an’ stop me; but otherwise the less
you say the more good we’ll get out’n this ’ere
conference.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To start in with, we’ve got a ship, an’ a
crew, an’ plenty o’ loose money. So what’ll we
do with ’em? Our business is to trade, an’ to
invest our money so we’ll make more with it.
What’s the best way to do that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He seemed to pause for an answer, so I said:
“I don’t know sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody <i>knows</i>, of course. But we can guess,
and then find out afterward if we’ve guessed
right. All business is a gamble; and, if it wasn’t,
most men would quit an’ go fishin’. After I
got back from Japan I met a lot o’ fellows that
had been to Alaska huntin’ gold. Seems like
Alaska’s full of gold, an’ before long the whole
country’ll be flockin’ there like sheep. All ’Frisco’s
gettin’ excited about the thing, so they tell
me, and if fortunes is goin’ to be made in Alaska,
we may as well speak for one ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we are not miners, Uncle; and it’s bitter
cold up there, they say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well put. We’ll let the crowds mine the
gold, and then hand it over to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I don’t understand,” said I,
weakly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No call for you to try, Sam. I’m your guardeen,
an’ so I’ll do the understandin’ for us both.
Folks has to eat, my lad, an’ gold-hunters is
usually too excited to make proper provisions fer
their stomachs. They’re goin’ to be mighty hungry
out in Alaska, before long, an’ when a man’s
hungry he’ll pay liberal fer a square meal. Let’s
give it to him, Sam, an’ take the consequences—which
is gold dust an’ nuggets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How will you do it, Uncle Nabe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Load the ‘Flipper’ with grub an’ carry it to
Kipnac, or up the Yukon as far as Fort Weare,
or wherever the gold fields open up. Then, when
the miners get hungry, they’ll come to us and
trade their gold for our groceries. We’re sure
to make big profits, Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks like a reasonable proposition, sir,”
I said. “But it seems to me rather dangerous.
Suppose our ship gets frozen in the ice, and we
can’t get away? And suppose about that time
we’ve sold out our provisions. We can’t eat gold.
And suppose——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“S’pose the moon falls out’n the sky,” interrupted
Uncle Naboth, “wouldn’t it be dark at
night, though!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the gold-diggers can live in the ice fields,
we can live in a good warm ship. And we’ll
keep enough grub for ourselves, you may be sure
of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When do we start?” I asked, feeling sure
that no arguments would move my uncle to abandon
the trip, once he had made up his mind to
undertake it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As soon as we can get the cargo aboard. It’s
coming on warmer weather, now, and this is the
best time to make the voyage. A steamer left today
with three hundred prospectors, an’ they’ll
be goin’ in bunches every day, now. Already I
estimate there’s over a thousand in the fields, so
we won’t get there any too soon to do business.
What do you say, Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve nothing to say, sir. Being my guardian,
you’ve decided the matter for both the partners,
as is right and proper. As your clerk and assistant,
I’ll obey whatever orders you give me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the proper spirit, lad!” he cried, with
enthusiasm. “We’ll go to work tomorrow morning;
and if all goes well we’ll be afloat in ten
days, with a full cargo!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />“NUX” AND “BRYONIA.”</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>On the seventh day of May, 1897, the “Flipper”
weighed anchor and sailed before a light
breeze through the Golden Gate and away on her
voyage toward Alaska and its gold fields. Stored
within her hold was a vast quantity of provisions
of the sort that could be kept indefinitely without
danger of spoiling. Flour, hams, bacon, sugar
and coffee were represented; but canned meats
and vegetables, tobacco and cheap cigars comprised
by far the greater part of the cargo. Uncle
Naboth had been seriously advised to carry a
good supply of liquors, but refused positively to
traffic in such merchandise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, my uncle rose many degrees in my
respect after I had watched for a time his preparations
for our voyage. Simple, rough and uneducated
he might be, but a shrewder man at a bargain
I have never met in all my experience. And
his reputation for honesty was so well established
that his credit was practically unlimited among
the wholesale grocers and notion jobbers of San
Francisco. Everyone seemed ready and anxious
to assist him, and the amount of consideration he
met with on every hand was really wonderful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve bought the right stuff, Sam,” he said
to me, as we stood on the deck and watched the
shore gradually recede, “and now we’ve got to
sell it right. That’s the secret of good tradin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was glad enough to find myself at sea,
where I could rest from my labors of the past two
weeks. I had been upon the docks night and day,
it seemed, checking off packages of goods as fast
as they were loaded on the lighters, and being
unaccustomed to work I tired very easily. But
my books were all accurate and “ship-shape,” and
I had found opportunity to fit up my little state-room
with many comforts. In this I had been
aided by Uncle Naboth, who was exceedingly liberal
in allowing me money for whatever I required.
At one time I said I would like to buy a
few books, and the next day, to my surprise, he
sent to my room a box containing the complete
works of Walter Scott and Robert Louis Stevenson,
with a miscellaneous collection of volumes
by standard authors.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know much about books myself,
Sam,” he said; “so I got a feller that <i>does</i> know
to pick ’em out for me, an’ I guess you’ll find ’em
the right sort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not tell him that I would have preferred
to make my own selection, and afterward I frankly
admitted to myself that the collection was an
admirable one.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time I had come to know all the officers
and crew, and found them a pretty good lot,
taken altogether. The principal “characters”
aboard were the dismal Captain Gay, who was
really as contented a man as I ever knew, Acker,
the ship’s doctor, and two queer black men called
by everybody Nux and Bryonia. Acker was a
big, burly Englishman, who, besides being doctor,
served as mate. He was jolly and good-natured
as the day was long, and had a few good stories
which he told over and over again, invariably
laughing at them more heartily than his auditors
did. Singularly enough, Captain Gay and “Doc”
Acker were close friends and cronies, and lived
together in perfect harmony.</p>

<p class='c009'>The black men interested me greatly from the
moment I first saw them. Bryonia, or “Bry,” as
he was more frequently called, was the cook, and
gave perfect satisfaction in that capacity. “Nux”
was man-of-all-work, serving the cabin mess, assisting
the cook, and acting as “able seaman”
whenever required. He proved competent in
nearly all ways, and was a prime favorite with
officers and men.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were natives of some small island of the
Sulu archipelago, and their history was a strange
one. In answer to my question as to why the
blacks were so queerly named, Uncle Naboth related
the following:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It were six years ago, or thereabout, as we
were homeward bound from our third Australy
trip, that we sighted a native canoe in the neighborhood
of the Caroline Islands. It was early in
the mornin’, and at first the lookout thought the
canoe was empty; but it happened to lay in our
course, and as we overtook it we saw two niggers
lyin’ bound in the bottom of the boat. So we
lay to, an’ picked ’em up, an’ when they was
histed aboard they were considerable more dead
ner alive. Bill Acker was our mate then, as he
is now, an’ in his early days he studied to be a
hoss doctor. So he always carries a box of medicines
with him, to fix up the men in case they gets
the jaundice or the colic. Mostly they’s pills, an’
sugar coated, for Doc hates to tackle drugs as is
very dangerous. An’ on account of a good deal
of sickness among the crew that trip, an’ consequently
a good deal of experimentin’ by Doc on
the medicine chest, the pills an’ such like was
nearly used up, though no one seemed much the
worse for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, after we’d cut the niggers’ bonds, an’
rubbed ’em good to restore the circulation, we
come near decidin’ they was dead an’ heavin’ of
’em overboard agin. But Doc wouldn’t give up.
He brought out the medicine box, an’ found that
all the stuff he had left was two bottles of pills,
one of ’em Nux Vomica, an’ the other Bryonia.
I was workin’ over one of the niggers, an’ Doc
he hands me one o’ the bottles an says: ‘Nux.’
So I emptied the bottle into the dead man’s mouth,
an’ by Jinks, Sam, he come around all right, and
is alive an’ kickin’ today. Cap’n Gay dosed the
other one with the Bryonia, an’ it fetched him in
no time. I won’t swear it were the pills, you
know; but the fact is the niggers lived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Afterwards we found the critters couldn’t
speak a word of English, ner tell us even what
their names were. So we called one Nux, and
the other Bryonia, accordin to the medicine that
had saved their lives, an’ they’ve answered to
those names ever since.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The blacks were gentle and good-natured, and
being grateful for their rescue they had refused to
leave the ship at the end of the voyage, and were
now permanent fixtures of the “Flipper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are not slaves, are they?” I asked, when
I had listened to this story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy, no!” exclaimed Uncle Naboth.
“They’re as free as any of us, an’ draw their
wages reg’lar. Also they’re as faithful as the
day is long, an’ never get drunk or mutinous. So
it were a lucky day when we picked ’em up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bryonia stood fully six feet in height, and
was muscular and wonderfully strong. He had
a fine face, too, and large and intelligent eyes.
Nux was much shorter, and inclined to be fat.
But he was not a bit lazy, for all that, and accomplished
an immense amount of work in so cheerful
a manner that never a complaint was laid at his
door. Not a sailor could climb aloft with more
agility or a surer foot, and both Nux and Bryonia
were absolutely fearless in the face of danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although these men were black they were not
Negroes, but belonged to a branch of the Malay
race. Their hair was straight, their noses well
formed and their eyes very expressive and intelligent.
The English they had picked up from the
crew, however, was spoken with an accent not unlike
that peculiar to the African Negroes, but with
a softer and more sibilant tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before I had been on the ship a week both
Nux and Bry were my faithful friends and devoted
followers, and in the days that were to
come their friendship and faithfulness stood me
in good stead.</p>

<p class='c009'>A very interesting person to me was big Bill
Acker, the mate, called by courtesy “Doc.” He
seemed far above his mates in the matter of intelligence,
and was evidently a well bred man in
his youth. A shelf above his bunk bore a well-thumbed
row of volumes on the world’s great religions,
together with a Talmud, a Koran, a Bible,
the works of Confucius and Max Müller’s translation
of the Vedas. One seemed to have been as
thoroughly read as the others, yet never have I
heard Doc Acker say one word, good or bad,
about religion. Whatever the result of his studies
might be, he kept his opinions strictly to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>A stiff breeze sprang up during the first night,
and the second day at sea found me miserably ill,
and regretting that I had ever trusted myself to
the mercies of cruel old ocean. Indeed, I lay in a
most pitiable plight until the big Englishman
came to me with doses of medicines from his
chest. He might have been merely “a hoss doctor,”
as Uncle Naboth had said; but certain it is
that his remedies helped me, and within twenty-four
hours I was again able to walk the deck in
comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps I had inherited some of my father’s
fondness for salt water, for my new life soon became
vastly interesting to me, and it was not long
before I felt entirely at home on the dingy old
“Flipper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning, after standing by the bulwarks
for a time watching the water slip by, I climbed
upon the rail and sat with my heels dangling over
the side. Suddenly I felt a strong hand grasp my
shoulder and draw me to the deck, and I turned
around indignantly to find black Nux beside me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad place to sit, Mars Sam,” he said, coolly;
“might tum’le ov’bode.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before I could reply, Uncle Naboth, who had
witnessed the incident, strolled up to us and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nux is right, my lad. You never find a sailor
sitting on the rail; they know too well how
onreliable the motion of a ship is. If anybody
drops overboard the chances o’ bein’ picked up
alive is mighty slim, I tell you. Only fools put
’emselves into unnecessary danger, Sam. Take
it on them orful railroad cars, for instance. Old
travellers always wait ’till the train stops afore
they gets on or off the cars. Them as don’t know
the danger is the ones that gets hurt. Same way
handlin’ a gun. An old hunter once told me he
never p’inted a gun at anything he didn’t want to
kill; but there’s a lot o’ folks killed ev’ry year that
don’t know the blamed thing is loaded. It ain’t
cowardly to be keerful, lad; but only fools an’ ignorant
people is reckless enough to get careless.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I am glad to say I took this lecture with good
humor, admitting frankly that Uncle Naboth was
right. At least once in the future a recollection of
this caution saved me from hopeless disaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the sixth day the breeze died away and the
ship lay still. There was not a breath of air, and
the heat was so intense that the interior of the
ship was like a furnace. At night we slept upon
the deck, and by day we lay gasping beneath the
shade of the tarpaulins. Bryonia let the galley
fire die out and served us cold lunches, but our
appetites were small.</p>

<p class='c009'>There being no occasion to work, the crew
gathered in little bunches and told a series of
never-ending yarns that were very interesting to
me, because most of them were of hair-breadth
adventures and escapes that were positively wonderful—if
one tried to believe them. One of the
best of these story-tellers was Ned Britton, who
had been appointed our boatswain and was already
popular with his mates. As his yarns were
all of the Atlantic, and most of the “Flipper’s”
crew had sailed only on the Pacific, Britton opened
to them a new field of adventures, which met
with universal approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux and Bry, who bore the heat better than
their white brethren, added to the general amusement
by giving exhibitions of the Moro war
dances, ending with desperate encounters, with
sticks to represent spears, that were sure to arouse
the entire crew to enthusiasm. They sometimes
sang their native war songs, also—a series of
monotonous, guttural chants. And then Dan Donnegan,
a little, red-whiskered Irishman, would
wind up with “Bryan O’Lynne” or some other
comic ditty that set the forecastle roaring with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>During this period of enforced idleness the
dismal Captain Gay walked the deck with solemn
patience and watched for signs of a breeze. Bill
Acker, the mate, read his religious library all
through—probably for the hundredth time. Uncle
Nabe taught me cribbage, and we played for
hours at a time, although I usually came out second
best at the game. Also I learned the ropes
of the ship and received many lessons in navigation
from my friends the sailors, not one of whom
knew anything about that abstruse problem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thay ain’t a man o’ the lot as could take the
ship back to ’Frisco, in case of emergency,” said
my uncle; and I believe he was right. Common
sailors are singularly ignorant of navigation, although
they have a way of deceiving themselves
into thinking they know all about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>After being becalmed six days, the intense heat
was at last relieved by a thin breeze, which sprung
up during the night. The sails were at once trimmed,
and within an hour the “Flipper” was skipping
the little waves to the satisfaction of all on
board.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the wind steadily increased, and by morning
all hands were called to shorten sail. By noon
we encountered a stiff gale, which blew from the
east, and soon lashed the waves into a mad frenzy.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the storm gradually increased Captain
Gay began to look anxious. There was a brief lull
toward evening, during which a great hail-storm
descended upon us, the icy bullets pelting the sailors
unmercifully and driving all to shelter. Then
the wind redoubled its fury, and the Captain put
the ship before it, allowing the gale to bear us
considerably out of our course.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth growled considerably at this
necessity, but he did not interfere in the least with
Captain Gay’s management of the ship. Safety
was more important to us than time, and Gay
was not a man to take unnecessary chances.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three wild days that followed have always
seemed to me since like a horrible dream. I
had no idea a ship could be so tossed and pounded
and battered about, and still live. It was a mere
chip on the great, angry ocean, and the water
washed our decks almost continually. After one
of these deluges, when every man strove to save
himself by clinging to the life lines, two of our
best sailors were missed, and we never saw them
again. Uncle Nabe began to whistle, and every
time he saw me he gave one of his humorous
winks or fell to chuckling in his silent way; but
my white face could not have been much encouragement
to gaiety, and I believe he was not over
merry himself, but merely trying to cheer me up.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, although the danger was so imminent,
not a man flinched or gave way to fear, and Nux
and Bryonia performed their duties as calmly as
if the sea were smooth. The vessel was staunch
enough, so far; but it pitched and tossed so violently
that even burly Doc Acker was obliged to
crawl into the cabin on his hands and knees to get
his meals.</p>

<p class='c009'>We fled before the wind until the third night,
when the rudder chain broke and the helmsman
was thrown, crushed and bleeding, against the lee
bulwarks. The “Flipper,” released from all control,
swung quickly around, and the big mainmast
snapped like a pipe-stem and came tumbling with
its cordage to the decks, where our brave sailors
rushed upon it and cut it clear. I thought the
ship would never right again, after the careening
given it by the fallen mast; but, somehow, it did,
and morning found us still afloat, although badly
crippled and at the mercy of the waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>As if satisfied with the havoc it had wrought,
the gale now abated; but the waves ran high for
another forty-eight hours, and our crew could do
nothing but cling to the remaining rigging and
await calmer weather.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately our ballast and cargo held in place
through all, and the hull showed no sign of a leak.
When the sea grew calmer we floated upright
upon the water and it was found our straits were
not nearly so desperate as we had feared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet our condition was serious enough to make
me wonder what was to become of us. The rudder
had been entirely washed away; the mainmast
was gone; the mizzenmast had broken at the head
and the foresail royals were in splinters. All the
deck was cumbered with rigging; the starboard
bulwarks had been stove in by the fallen mast,
and our crew was lessened by three able seamen.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Captain Gay, no less dismal than before,
you may be sure, promptly began to issue orders,
and the men fell to with a will to repair the damage
as best they might. First they rigged up a
temporary rudder and swung it astern. It was a
poor makeshift, however, and only with good
weather could we hope it would steer us to the
nearest port.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the men cleared the decks and rigged
up a jury mast under the supervision of the mate,
Captain Gay took our bearings and ascertained
that we had not departed so greatly from our
course as we had feared. Yet it was impossible
to make the mouth of the Yukon in our present
condition, or even to reach a shelter in Bering
Sea. It was found, however, that the Alaska
peninsula was not far away, so we decided to
draw as near to that as possible, in the hope of
meeting a passing vessel or finding a temporary
refuge on some one of the numerous islands that
lie in this part of the North Pacific.</p>

<p class='c009'>For four days we labored along, in our crippled
condition, without sighting land; but then
our fortunes changed. During the night a good
breeze from the southwest swept us merrily along,
and when daylight came we found ourselves close
to a small, wooded island. It lay in the form of
a horse-shoe, with a broad, protected bay in the
center, and Captain Gay, anxious to examine his
ship more closely, decided at once to enter the
harbor and cast anchor.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was by no means an easy task, for long
lines of reefs extended from each point of the
shore, almost enclosing the bay with jagged rocks.
But the sea was calm and the position of the reefs
clearly marked; so that by skillful maneuvering
the “Flipper” passed between them in safety, and
to the relief and satisfaction of all on board we
dropped our anchor in the clear waters of the bay.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />THE LAND OF MYSTERY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Captain Gay examined his chart with minute
care, and solemnly shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The island was not there. Either the chart
was imperfect, or we had reached a hitherto undiscovered
land. The latter conjecture was not
at all unreasonable, for so many islands lay in
this neighborhood that even when sighted by
chance an outlying islet was little liable to tempt
one to land upon it. This was doubtless one of
the numerous group lying to the south-east of the
Alaska peninsula, which are of volcanic origin
and as a rule barren and uninhabited.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have said this island was well wooded, but
not until we were opposite the mouth of the natural
harbor did we observe this fact. From the
sea only a line of rugged headlands and peaks
showed plainly, and had we not been in distress
we should never have thought to stop at this place.
Once within the harbor, however, the scene that
met our view was not unattractive.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bordering the bay was a sandy beach a full
hundred yards in width, broken only by an
inlet toward the left, or south, which seemed
to lead into the interior of the island, winding between
high and precipitous banks and soon becoming
lost to sight. Back of the beach was the
clean-cut edge of a forest, not following a straight
line, but rising and falling in hills and ravines until
it seemed from the bay to have been scalloped
into shape by a pair of huge scissors. The woods
were thick and the trees of uniform size, and between
them grew a mass of vines and underbrush
that made them almost impenetrable. How far
the forest extended we were unable to guess; nor
did we know how wide the island might be, for
back of the hills rose a range of wooded mountains
nearly a thousand feet in height, and what
might lie beyond these was of course a matter of
conjecture. Uncle Naboth, however, advanced
the opinion that the island ended at the mountain
peaks, and dropped sheer down to the sea beyond.
He had seen many formations of that sort, and
supposed we had found the only possible harbor
on the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no apparent indication that the island
had ever before been visited by man. Even
signs of natives occupation were lacking. But
Captain Gay decided to send a small boat ashore
to explore the inlet before we could relax all vigilance
and feel that we were not liable to attack
or interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the gig was lowered, and four of the crew,
accompanied by Bill Acker, the mate, set off upon
their voyage of discovery. They rowed straight
to the inlet, which proved to be navigable, and
soon after entering it we lost sight of the boat as
it wound between the wooded cliffs.</p>

<p class='c009'>We waited patiently an hour; two hours; three
hours; but the boat did not return. Then patience
gave way to anxiety, and finally the suspense became
unbearable. After the loss of our three sailors
during the storm we were reduced to eleven
men, besides Uncle Naboth and myself, who
were not counted members of the crew. Thirteen
on board was not an especially lucky number, so
that some of the men had been looking for disaster
of some sort ever since we sighted the island.
Those now remaining on the “Flipper” were the
Captain, Ned Britton and two other sailors, Nux
and Bryonia, my Uncle and myself; eight, all
told. To send more men after the five who were
absent would be to reduce our numbers more than
was wise; yet it was impossible for us to remain
inactive. Finally, Ned Britton offered to attempt
to make his way through the woods, along the
edge of the inlet, and endeavor to find out what
had become of Acker and his men. He armed
himself with two revolvers and a stout cutlass,
and then we rowed him to the shore and watched
him start on his expedition.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not expecting that Ned would be long absent,
we did not at once return to the ship. Instead,
the Captain backed the boat into deep water and
lay to, that we might pick up our messenger
when he reappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>It had been agreed that if Ned came upon the
mate he was to fire two shots in quick succession,
to let us know that all was well. If he encountered
danger he was to fire a single shot. If he
wished us to come to his assistance he would fire
three shots. But the afternoon passed slowly and
quietly, and no sound of any kind came from the
interior to relieve our anxiety. The boat returned
to the ship, and Bryonia served our supper amid
an ominous and gloomy silence on the part of
those few who were left.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was something uncanny about this mysterious
disappearance of our comrades. Had they
been able to return or to communicate with us
there was no doubt they would have done so;
therefore their absence was fraught with unknown
but no less certain terror. Big Bill Acker
was a man of much resource, and absolutely to be
depended upon; and Ned Britton, who had been
fully warned and would be on his guard against
all dangers, was shrewd and active and not liable
to be caught napping.</p>

<p class='c009'>What, then, had they encountered? Wild
beasts, savages, or some awful natural phenomenon
which had cruelly destroyed them? Our
imaginations ran riot, but it was all imagination,
after all, and we were no nearer the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>An anxious night passed, and at daybreak
Uncle Naboth called a council of war, at which
all on board were present. We faced a hard proposition,
you may be sure, for not one of us had
any information to guide him, and all were alike
in the dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>To desert our absent friends and sail away
from the island was impossible, even had we desired
to do so; for our numbers were too small to
permit us to work the disabled “Flipper” in safety,
and the ship’s carpenter, on whom we greatly
depended, had gone with the mate. All repairs
must be postponed until the mystery of the men’s
disappearance was solved; and we firmly resolved
that those of us remaining must not separate, but
stick together to the last, and stick to the ship, as
well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Good resolutions, indeed; but we failed to consider
the demands of an aroused curiosity. After
two days had dragged their hours away without
a sign of our absent comrades human nature
could bear the suspense no longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth called another council, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys, we’re actin’ like a pack o’ cowards.
Let’s follow after our friends, an’ find ’em, dead
or alive. We oughtn’t to shrink from a danger
we sent ’em into; and if we can’t rescue ’em, let’s
run the chance of dyin’ with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This sentiment met with general approval. All
felt that the time for action had arrived, and if
there was a reluctant man among us he made no
sign.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early next morning we partook of a hasty
breakfast and then tumbled into the long boat to
begin our quest. Every one on the ship was to
accompany the expedition, for no one cared to
be left behind. Uncle Naboth at first proposed
to leave me on board, in the care of Bry; but I
pleaded hard to go with the rest, and it was evident
that I would be in as much danger aboard as
in the company of the exploring party. So it
was decided to take me along, and we practically
deserted the ship, taking with us a fair supply of
provisions and plenty of ammunition. The men
were fully armed, and my uncle even intrusted
me with a revolver, for I had learned to shoot
fairly well.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a beautiful morning, cool and fresh and
sunny, as we rowed away from the ship and
headed for the inlet. That unknown and perhaps
terrible dangers lay ahead of us we had good
reason to expect; but every man was alert and
vigilant and eager to unravel the mystery of this
strange island.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />THE MAJOR.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Presently we shot into the opening and passed
swiftly up the smooth waters of the inlet. The
hills were gradually sloping, at first, and we could
look into the tangled mass of forest that lay on
either hand. But soon the sides of the channel
became rocky and precipitous, rising higher and
higher until we found ourselves in a deep gorge
that wound between gigantic overhanging cliffs.
The waters of the inlet were still smooth, but it
narrowed perceptibly, all the time curving sharply
to the right and then to the left in a series of
zig-zags; so that every few minutes we seemed
to be approaching a solid rocky wall, which suddenly
disclosed a continuation of the channel to
right angles with it, allowing us to continue on
our course.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was indeed necessary to watch out, in such
a place as this, for we were passing through the
heart of the mountain, and could not tell from one
moment to another what lay before us.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was barely room on each side for the
sweep of the oars, so that we had to pull straight
and carefully; but after a time the deep gloom in
which we were engulfed began to lighten, and we
were aware that the slope of the mountain was
decreasing, and we were approaching its further
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>On and on we rowed, twisting abruptly this
way and that, until suddenly, as we turned a sharp
corner and shot into open, shallow water, the adventure
culminated in a mighty surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were surrounded by a band of men—big,
brawny fellows who stood waist deep in the
water and threw coils of rope about us before we
were quite aware of their presence. At the same
time they caught the boat and arrested its progress,
jerking the oars from the hands of our
rowers and making us fast prisoners.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only Bryonia was quicker than the men who
sought to entrap him. Before the noose could
settle over his shoulders he leaped into the air and
dove headlong beneath the water. But the brave
attempt to escape was all in vain, for as he rose
to the surface a dozen hands caught him and drew
him to the shore, where, despite his struggles, he
was bound as securely as the rest of us.</p>

<p class='c009'>So unexpected was the attack and so cleverly
were we mastered that scarcely a word was uttered
by our little party as we stared in astonishment
into the rough and bearded faces of our
captors. Only Captain Gay muttered a string of
naughty words under his breath; the rest were
silent, and Uncle Naboth, bound round and round
with rope so that he could not move, sat in his
seat and looked across at me with one of his
quaintest winks, as if he would cheer me up in
this unexpected crisis.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor had a word been spoken by the men who
entrapped us. Wading slowly through the water,
they drew our boat to a sandy shore and beached
it, while we looked curiously around upon the
scene that was now clearly unfolded to our view.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cliffs had ended abruptly, and the center
of the island, flat and broad, lay stretched before
us. The waters of the inlet from here became
shallow, and a wide beach of strangely bright
sands extended for two hundred feet on either
side of it. Then came the jungle, thick and seemingly
impenetrable, beyond which all was unknown.
Straight and without a ripple the water
lay before us a full quarter of a mile, disappearing
thence into the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the thick sands of the east shore, where
we now were, a number of rude huts had been
erected, shaped something like Indian tepees and
made of intertwined branches covered with leaves
from the forest. These stood in a row near to the
edge of the jungle, so as to take advantage of its
shade.</p>

<p class='c009'>But more strange than all this was the appearance
of the men who had bound us. They were
evidently our own countrymen, and from their
dress and manners seemed to be miners. But
nearly all were in rags and tatters, as if they
had been long away from civilization, and their
faces were fierce and brutal, bearing the expression
of wild beasts in search of prey.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of them, however, who stood upon the
beach regarding us silently and with folded arms,
was a personage so remarkable that he instantly
riveted our attention. His height was enormous—at
least six feet and three inches—and
his chest was broad and deep as that of ancient
Hercules. He was bearded like a gorilla with
fiery red hair, which extended even to his great
chest, disclosed through the open grey flannel
shirt. There was no hat upon his head, and he
wore no coat; but high boots were upon his feet
and around his waist a leathern belt stuck full of
knives and revolvers.</p>

<p class='c009'>No stage pirate, no bandit of Southern Europe,
was ever half so formidable in appearance as
this terrible personage. He stood motionless as
a pillar of stone, but his little red eyes, quick and
shrewd, roved from one to another of our faces,
as if he were making a mental estimate of each
one of us—like the ogre who selected his fattest
prisoner to grace his pot-pie.</p>

<p class='c009'>I own that I shuddered as his glance fell upon
me; and we were all more or less disquieted by
our rough seizure and the uncertainty of the fate
that awaited us.</p>

<p class='c009'>This man—the red giant—was undoubtedly
the leader of the outlaw band, for having pulled
our boat upon the beach and dragged Bryonia to a
position beside it, all eyes were turned enquiringly
upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He strode forward a few steps, fixed his eyes
firmly upon Uncle Naboth, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you leave anyone aboard the ship?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave a start of surprise. The voice of the
huge bandit was as gentle and soft as that of a
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said my uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess, Major, we’ve got ’em all now,” remarked
one of the men.</p>

<p class='c009'>The giant nodded and turned again to Uncle
Naboth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must pardon us, sir, for our seeming
rudeness,” said he, with a politeness that seemed
absolutely incongruous, coming from his coarse,
hairy lips. “My men and I are in desperate
straights, and only desperate remedies will avail
to save us. I beg you all to believe that we have
no personal enmity toward you whatever.” Then
he turned to his men, and with a wave of his hand
added: “Bring them along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thereat we were jerked from our seats in
the boat and led away over the sands toward the
edge of the jungle. I noticed that our arms and
provisions, being confiscated, were carried into
one of the huts, but we ourselves were dragged
past these and through an opening in the trees
just large enough to admit us single file.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few steps from the edge we entered a circular
clearing, perhaps a dozen paces in diameter,
hemmed in on all sides by a perfect network of
tangled brushwood and vines. Here, to our great
joy, we came upon our lost comrades, all seated
at the base of slender trees, to which they were
bound by stout ropes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurrah!” cried Bill Acker, a smile lighting
his careworn face. “It’s a joy to see you again,
my boys, although you seem to have fallen into
the same trap we did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beg parding, Cap’n, for getting myself
caught,” said Net Britton, quite seriously. “The
brutes jumped me so quick I hadn’t time to fire
a shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Ned; you’re not to blame,” said
Captain Gay, and while we were interchanging
greetings our captors were busily engaged in securing
us to trees, in the same manner the others
were bound. We protested, very naturally, at
such treatment, but the men, surly and rough, answered
us not a word, and after making sure we
could not get away they withdrew and left us
alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the trees to which we were fastened were
at the edge of the clearing we were seated in a
sort of circle, facing one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys,” said Uncle Naboth, “here’s a
pretty kettle o’ fish, I must say! The whole crew o’
the ‘Flipper,’ officers an’ men an’ supercargo, has
been caught like so many turtles, an’ turned on
their backs; an’ all we can do is to kick and wish
we had our legs agin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We all seemed rather ashamed of ourselves.
Captain Gay heaved a most dismal sigh, and turning
to Acker asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are these people, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t say, I’m sure, Tom. We rowed up the
inlet, not expecting any danger, when suddenly
the whole lot jumped us and made us prisoners in
the wink of an eye. They brought us before a red
devil called the Major, who pumped us to find
out how many men were aboard ship. When we
refused to give them any information they
brought us to this place, and here we’ve been ever
since, fast bound and half starved, for I guess
the fellows haven’t much to eat themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did they come here?” asked my uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, sir,” replied Acker, “they haven’t
told us one word about themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fer my part,” said Ned Britton, speaking in
his deliberate manner, “I think these pirates has
been spyin’ on us ever since we anchored in the
bay. They must have a path over the mountains
that we don’t know of, for when the mate come
up the inlet in the gig they was ready an’ waitin’
for him, and he didn’t have a chance to resist.
’Twere the same with me, sir. I crep’ along the
edge o’ the channel, goin’ slow an’ swingin’ myself
from tree to tree over the gulch—for the trees
was too thick to get between ’em—until I come
to this here place, where two men grabbed me an’
knocked me down an’ tied me up like a pig sent to
market. The Major were with ’em, and swore
he’d murder me if I didn’t tell him how many
more were aboard the ship, an’ what her cargo
was, an’ where we are bound for, an’ a dozen
other things. But I kep’ mum, sir, as were my
duty, an’ finally they brung me to this place,
where I was mighty glad to find the mate and his
men safe and sound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We then related our own anxiety over the fate
of those who had so mysteriously disappeared,
and our final expedition in search of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve found you, all right,” said Uncle
Naboth, in conclusion; “but now the question is,
what’s goin’ to become of us, an’ what shall we
do to escape from these blamed pirates that’s
captured us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before you answer that question,” said a
quiet voice, “it may be as well for you to listen
to what I have to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We looked up and saw the great form of the
Major standing in the clearing. How much of
our conversation he had overheard we did not
know; but after a lowering glance into our startled
faces he calmly seated himself in the midst of the
circle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thirteen, all told,” he said. “You seem
shorthanded, for so big a schooner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We lost three men in the storm,” said Uncle
Naboth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you, the owner?” asked the Major.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Part owner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is your cargo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mixed,” replied Uncle Naboth, non-commitally.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major reflected a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall soon find out all we wish to know,”
he said. “We have both your boats, and we can
examine the ship for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I s’pose you know this is a hangin’ matter?”
suggested my uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may be,” was the calm reply. “At any
rate, it is illegal, and I regret that circumstances
force us to act illegally with you. As a matter of
fact, I wish that I might have treated you with
more courtesy. But you had no business to come
to this island, and having come here, and surprised
our great secret by penetrating into the
center of the land, you must take the consequences
of your folly. We did not want you here, and we
kept out of your way as long as you would let
us. When you invaded our private domain we
were forced to protect ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand,” said my uncle, much
puzzled by this speech. “We’re no robbers, ner
pirates. We’re peaceful citizens of the United
States.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So are we,” retorted the Major. “But we’re
also the creatures of fate, and our condition here
forces us to wage warfare upon any who intrude
into our privacy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We put in here for repairs, an’ it was natural
we should want to explore the island,” returned
my uncle, doggedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major appeared lost in thought. For
several minutes he sat staring at the ground with
a great frown wrinkling his brow. For our part,
we watched him curiously, wondering the while
what would be the outcome of the queer condition
in which we found ourselves. Finally the
man spoke:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under the circumstances,” said he, “there
are but two courses open to us. One is to murder
every man of you, and bury you underneath the
sands. I imagine you would be safe there, and
not a soul on earth would ever know what had
become of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I shuddered. The soft tones could not disguise
the horror of the words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The alternative,” continued the Major, “is
to swear you to secrecy, to induce you to work
for us for fair wages, and finally to sail back with
you in your ship to San Francisco, where we may
part good friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The contrast between these propositions was
so great that we stared at the man in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we are to take our choice,” said Uncle
Naboth, “it won’t be the grave under the sands,
you may be sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The choice does not lie with you, but with
my men,” returned the Major, coolly. “For my
part, I am neither bloodthirsty nor inclined to
become a murderer; so I shall use my influence
in your behalf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With this he slowly rose to his feet and stalked
from the clearing, leaving us to reflections that
were not entirely comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hours passed drearily enough. Toward
evening some of the men brought us a few moldy
ship’s biscuits and a bucket of sweet drinking
water, and after partaking of this we were left to
ourselves until the next daybreak.</p>

<p class='c009'>As it grew dusk Nux suddenly rose from his
seat, and we saw that he was free. In some way
he had managed to slip his bonds, and he passed
quickly from one to another of us until we were
all released from the dreadful ropes that had been
chafing us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then a council of war was held. Our captors
numbered about thirty, and all were fully armed.
To attempt to oppose them openly would be madness;
but if we could manage to slip away and
regain our boats we should be able to reach our
ship and so escape. Bryonia agreed to spy out
our surroundings and see where the boats lay, so
he fell upon all fours and silently crept from the
clearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>We awaited his return with impatience, but
he was not gone long. He re-entered the clearing
walking upright and indifferent to crackling
twigs, and then we knew our case was hopeless.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dere’s men sleepin’ in de boats, an’ men on
watch,” said he; “an’ dey all has swords an’ pistols.
Can’t get away anyhow, Mars Perkins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about the woods?” asked my uncle.
“Can’t we escape through them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry shook his head, decisively. He was an
expert woodsman, and declared no man could
penetrate the thick jungle that hemmed us in.
Ned Britten also bore testimony to this fact; so
we were obliged to sadly abandon any hope of
escape, and stretched ourselves as comfortably as
we might upon the ground to await the approach
of morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>With the first streaks of day the Major and
a dozen of his men arrived, and without appearing
to notice that we had slipped our bonds they
drove us in a pack from the clearing and out upon
the sands that bordered the inlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here we saw others of our captors busy preparing
breakfast before the entrances to the rude
huts, and it was evident that they were using the
provisions they had captured from us, for I
scented the aroma of the coffee that Uncle Naboth
was so proud of, and carried with him
wherever he went.</p>

<p class='c009'>We gathered before the hut of the Major,
which was somewhat larger than the others, and
then the leader said, in a tone of stern command:
“Take off your clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We hesitated, not quite understanding the
purpose of the order.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strip, my boys,” said another of the pirates,
with a grin. “We want your togs. We drew cuts
for ’em last night, and now we’ll trade you our
rags for ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So we stripped and tossed our clothes upon
the ground, where they were eagerly seized by
the outlaws and donned with great satisfaction.
The Major did not participate in this robbery;
but, indeed, no garment that we wore could possibly
have fitted his huge frame.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we had put on the rags discarded by
the others we were a curious looking lot, you may
be sure. Uncle Naboth had a fit of silent merriment
at my expense, but if he could have seen
himself I am sure he would have choked and sputtered
dangerously. A more disreputable appearance
than that we now presented would be hard
to imagine; but our enemies did not profit so
greatly by the exchange, after all, for the garments
fitted them as badly as theirs did us. However,
they seemed very proud of their acquisition,
and strutted around like so many vain peacocks.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE SANDS OF GOLD.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The sun had now arisen and flooded the scene
with its glorious rays. We were given some of
the coffee and a scant allowance of food for our
breakfast, the care with which the latter was
doled out being evidence that our captors did
not know that the “Flipper” was loaded down
with provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the meal was concluded we all
gathered around the Major’s hut again, and he
began to make us an address.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the conference held last evening,” he began,
in his smooth tone, “we decided to allow you
to choose your own fate. It is death on the one
hand, and life as our paid employees on the other.
What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’d like to know, sir,” said Uncle Naboth,
“what you are doing on this island?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Washing gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gold!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure,” said the Major. “Are you so
ignorant that you cannot see that these sands
upon which you are standing are wonderfully
rich in gold?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I hadn’t noticed,” said my uncle, and
then we all curiously stared at the bright billows
of sand that filled the beach on both sides of the
inlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will do no harm to explain to you how we
came here, and what we are doing,” said the
Major. “It will help you to make your decision.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seems like a queer place to look for gold,”
said Uncle Naboth, reflectively. “But even then
I can’t see why you’ve treated us like you have,
or why you’re so blamed secret about the thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you?” was the reply. “Then I must
jog your reason with a few sensible suggestions.
Every gold field yet discovered has been a magnet
to draw men from every part of the civilized
world. The result has been that the first discoverers
seldom profit to any extent, while the
horde they draw around them get the lion’s share.
That has been our experience time and time again,
for every member of our band is an experienced
miner. We’ve been crowded from Colorado to
Idaho, from Idaho to California, from California
to the Black Hills, and back again. Finally we
got word of a rich find of gold in Alaska; so,
banding together, we chartered an old ship and
started for the Yukon. On the way we encountered
a gale that blew us to this island. We don’t
know what island it is, and we don’t care. While
our vessel was undergoing repairs we rowed up
the inlet, as you did, and discovered these sands,
which are marvelously rich with grains of pure
gold. Before your eyes, gentlemen, lies the greatest
natural accumulation of gold the world has
ever known.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He paused, after this impressive statement,
and again we looked around wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t get it all, that’s true,” resumed the
Major; “but we have decided to stay here and defend
our secret until each one of us has secured
an independent fortune. Then the swarms of
gold-hunters can settle here as thickly as they
please. Of course we had our tools with us, and
a good supply of provisions; so we were glad to
let Alaska take care of itself and go to work washing
out the wealth that lay at our feet. We knew
the food wouldn’t last till we were ready to leave
here, so we decided to send the ship home for
more provisions. The captain was bound to secrecy
by promise of a big share for himself, but
soon after he sailed away a great storm arose, and
probably the old, leaky craft never weathered it,
for that was over a year ago, and no ship has
reached this harbor until yours appeared.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We listened to this recital with eager interest,
for it explained much that had puzzled us. And
Uncle Naboth remarked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a strange story, sir. But I don’t see why
you treated us as enemies when we came here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose you had been prospectors, like ourselves.
What would become of our secret then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we’re not,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was even possible our captain might have
reached shore and betrayed us. In that case you
might be the forerunners of an army of invaders.
We couldn’t take the chances, sir. We’ve been
disappointed too many times. But it appears that
you were merely the victims of the elements, and
like ourselves were driven to this shore in a gale.
So the only danger to be feared from you is your
getting away before we’re ready to go with you.
That was why we hesitated between murdering
you and using your services to enable us to accomplish
our task sooner than we otherwise
could. We are not cut-throats, believe me, nor
do we care to be responsible for the death of so
many decent men. But the lust for gold has
made my fellows desperate, and with immense
fortunes within their grasp they will stick at
nothing to protect themselves and their treasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s only natural,” growled Uncle Naboth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to find you so reasonable,” said the
Major. “Having discovered this field ourselves,
we do not intend to share the gold with anyone;
but we will make you a reasonable proposition.
We will pay each one of you two dollars a day,
in grains of gold, for your labor, and you must
buckle to and help us to get out the gold. We
will also pay you, in gold, for whatever provisions
you have on your ship, or other supplies we may
need. And when we have enough to satisfy ourselves,
and are ready to sail back to civilization,
we will pay you a reasonable price for passage
in your ship. That seems to me to be fair and
square. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” answered Uncle Naboth, with a gasp,
“that’s all we could look for if we got to Alaska.
We’re traders, sir, an’ expect to make our money
in trade. The only thing we object to is workin’
like dogs to wash gold for somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have to put up with that objection,”
returned the man, dryly. “Your labor will shorten
our stay here a full year, and it’s the penalty you
must suffer for being in our power.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My uncle turned to his crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say, boys?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some grumbled, and all looked grave; but a
glance at the lowering faces of the miners assured
them that discretion was the better part of valor,
so they yielded a reluctant consent to the arrangement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s one p’int, howsomever, as I should
like to argufy,” said Uncle Naboth. “This here
lad’s too small an’ delicate to work at the washin’,
an’ somebody’s got to give out the provisions an’
collect the pay for ’em. Let him out o’ the deal,
sir, an’ make him clerk o’ the supplies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will agree to that,” said the Major,
promptly. “When we get back to the States we
don’t want to have anything against our record;
so this bargain shall be kept faithfully on our side.
I’ll prepare a paper, which every man here must
sign, stating that you accept the agreement freely
and without compulsion, and will be satisfied with
your wages and the payment for your groceries
and supplies. Also you must each one take an
oath not to betray to anyone the whereabouts of
this island after you leave it, for it will be a valuable
possession to us even after we’ve taken
enough gold from it to make us rich. Meantime
you’ll be well treated, but carefully watched. To
some extent you’ll be, morally, our prisoners; but
the only hardship you will suffer is to labor hard
for a few months at a small salary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s agreeable, sir,” said my uncle; and
the men accepted the arrangement with more or
less grace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the conference broke up. Our sailors,
as well as Captain Gay, the mate and my uncle,
were at once set to work washing gold on the
banks of the inlet, their numbers being distributed
among the miners, who showed them what to do
and supervised the work. It appeared that all
the gold gathered by our people was to go into
a common pot, to be distributed equally among
our captors; but each miner worked for himself
alone, and was entitled to whatever he secured.
In this way a premium was set upon individual industry,
and they worked eagerly and persistently,
at the same time insisting that the “Flipper’s”
crew did not loiter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major, whose influence over his rough
comrades was undoubted, retired within his tent
to draft the paper we were to sign, and I, left to
my own devices, wandered here and there, watching
the men and wondering what would be the
outcome of this singular adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>At noon the paper was ready, and it set forth
clearly and fairly the terms of the agreement.
We were all required to sign it, as well as every
miner in the camp, and then the Major took
possession of it, there being no duplicate.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the midday meal six of our sailors were
selected to man the long boat, and then accompanied
by the Major, who was fully armed, and
by myself, they rowed down the inlet to the harbor,
and we boarded the ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>I selected such of the provisions as were most
needed by the half starved miners, and also carried
away a number of blankets, as the nights
were chill and the blankets would prevent much
suffering.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two trips we made that afternoon, and when
the miners stopped work for the day I had quite
a heap of groceries piled upon the sands. Instantly
they surrounded me, clamoring for supplies,
which I served to each man as he demanded
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They paid me in grains of pure gold, which
they drew from sacks, old stockings tied with a
string, and even pockets cut from their clothing.
How much to demand I did not know, and some
paid me too much, I suppose, and some too little.
One of them, a low-browed, black bearded fellow
called Larkin, obtained a quantity of goods
and then said he would pay me some other time;
but the Major insisted that I be paid then and
there. So the man laid down a pinch of gold,
saying it was enough, and I was about to accept
it when the Major drew his revolver and said,
quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a fair deal, Larkin. Shell out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fellow uttered a string of angry oaths,
but he added to his first offering until his leader
was satisfied, and then went away vowing “to get
even with the robbers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To avoid further trouble, I brought a small
pair of scales from the ship next day. They were
not very accurate, I fear, but they were much better
than guesswork. The Major and I figured
out exactly what weight of gold should stand for
a dollar, and I was allowed to put my own price
on our supplies; but I took care not to be exorbitant
in my demands, and most of the men
expressed themselves as well satisfied with the
arrangement.</p>

<p class='c009'>As a good share of the provisions would suffer
by being left out in the night air, it was decided
to build a warehouse for my use: “a reg’lar
grocery store,” Uncle Naboth described it; so
the men all set to work, and under the direction
of our ship’s carpenter soon constructed a roomy
and comfortable hut for this purpose. By repeated
trips to the ship in the long boat, I soon
accumulated a good stock of everything our
cargo represented, and by taking off the covers
of the boxes and then piling them on their edges,
in rows, I soon made my hut look like a prosperous
mercantile establishment. Surplus and unopened
boxes were utilized to form a counter in
front of my stock, and here I placed my scales
and weighed the gold that was offered in payment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The men were as prodigal as all miners are,
and denied themselves nothing so long as they
had gold to pay for it. So my stock gradually increased
in gold and diminished in merchandise,
and the men were well fed and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sands upon which we so carelessly
trod were wonderfully rich in the precious metal,
and any sort of industry was sure to be repaid
enormously by the glittering grains scattered
about. It was not dust, you understand, but tiny
grains resembling those of granulated sugar. The
richest yield was derived from the sands at the
bottom of the shallow inlet, and the practice of
the miners was to wade a little way into the
stream, scoop up a basin off the sandy bottom and
wash it until only the specks of sparkling metal
remained. As it was difficult to care for this
properly, I brought from the ship a quantity of
sail-cloth, which I made, during my leisure moments,
into stout bags, about the size of salt-sacks,
sewing the seams firmly. These bags I sold
readily to the miners, who, when they filled one,
would usually bury it beneath the sand in their
hut, so that it would be safe. I did not do this
with my supply, however, but piled my sacks into
an empty box in one corner of my grocery store,
feeling sure there would be no theft of them in
the confines of our little camp. Neither did the
Major secrete his hoard, which lay plainly in
sight of anyone who entered his hut; and the Major’s
store of gold was enormous because he took
charge of all that our men washed out, until the
time for final division should arrive.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no game of any sort, that we knew
of, upon the island; but the men caught plenty of
fish in the upper part of the inlet and in the bay
upon the ocean frontage. The thickets surrounding
our camp were considered absolutely impenetrable,
on account of the underbrush and creeping
vines that formed such a thick network at the
foot of the trees. Yet there was a man named
Daggett who, it was rumored, had found a way
to traverse the forest with comparative ease.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Daggett was quite a remarkable person,
and enters now into my story.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a thin, withered little man, about fifty
years of age, who had been an unsuccessful miner
all his life until now. So eager was he, at first,
to take advantage of the great opportunities here
afforded to secure a fortune, that he would work
by moonlight washing gold, while his companions
slept and rested from their labors. But soon
he conceived an idea that these golden sands were
deposited from some point in the mountains of
the interior of the island, where solid gold
abounded in enormous quantities. So he quit
washing, and began a search for the imaginary
“mountain of gold,” cutting a secret path through
the thicket to the more open interior, and passing
day after day in his eager quest. At first he urged
some of his comrades to join him, but they only
laughed at his idea, being well content to obtain
the coveted gold in an easy way, where it lay
plainly before their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Daggett did not desist, spending day after
day in roaming through the wild hills in his fruitless
search. During the time he lost in this way
his mates were accumulating a vast store of golden
grains, while Daggett was as yet only in possession
of the result of his first eager labors; and
after I opened my grocery store he was obliged to
exchange pinches of his small substance for supplies,
so that it gradually dwindled away to a
mere nothing. He haggled so over the price of
every article he secured that his fellows jeered
him unmercifully, calling him “the miser” and
berating him for neglecting his opportunities. Indeed,
the poor fellow was well-nigh desperate, at
the last, for he alone of all the camp was still
poor, and his only salvation, he considered, was to
find the hills of solid gold before the time came for
all to abandon the island. So he was gone for
days, returning to camp to secure provisions; and
no one knew where he wandered or seemed to care.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />THE OUTLAWS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>There were many curious characters at the
camp, as I suppose there are everywhere that a
number of men are gathered together. I used
to amuse myself studying the various phases of
human nature that came under my observation,
with the result that some men attracted me and
some repelled me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aside from the miserly Daggett the man who
caused me the most trouble was the surly, scowling
Larkin, whom the Major had threatened to
shoot on sight if he did not pay me for everything
he obtained at my shop. He was a lazy fellow,
and did not seem to get ahead as fast as his companions,
for that reason. Sometimes, in the heat
of the afternoon, he would strike work and come
into my hut, where he threatened and bullied me
and cast longing glances at the sacks of gold I
had accumulated. Uncle Naboth, who, by the
way, labored doggedly day after day, as he was
commanded, often warned me against Larkin,
but I had no fears, being assured the Major would
protect me from the villain’s hatred.</p>

<p class='c009'>One or two others—Hayes and Judson, for
instance—were evidently disreputable characters,
and affected the society of Larkin when they were
not at work. But in the main the miners were
decent enough fellows, and seemed to have no
thought above securing a fortune from the wealth
of the golden sands. They paid me liberally,
were just in their dealings, and labored industriously
day by day so as to lessen the time of
their captivity upon the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the evenings the officers and crew of the
“Flipper” were wont to gather in my hut, where
they smoked their pipes and conversed more or
less gloomily together. None of them, however,
was greatly distressed at his fate, and it was wonderful
how cheerful Uncle Naboth remained
through it all. His silent merriment and sly winks
were by no means lacking in these days of tribulations
and hard work, and he found many opportunities
to exercise his keen sense of humor. In
one way his fortunes were really prospering, and
each evening he weighed out the day’s receipts, in
golden grains, and calculated the profits to us on
the sales. I suppose these must have been satisfactory,
for he never complained.</p>

<p class='c009'>I always slept in my hut, surrounded by the
store of merchandise and my sacks of gold; but
the rest of the crew of the ship had huts of their
own, Nux and Bryonia occupying one together.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night, after I had been asleep for some
hours, I was suddenly awakened by the muzzle
of a pistol pressed close to my forehead. I
opened my eyes, and saw Larkin standing beside
me. A tallow candle had been lighted in the hut,
and I could see his evil features distinctly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Now, my lad, keep quiet an’ you won’t get hurt.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my lad,” said he, “keep quiet an’ you
won’t get hurt. But if you raise any rumpus or
make a sound, I’ll blow your brains out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So I lay quiet, but I kept my eyes open and
eagerly watched what was taking place in the
room. Besides Larkin, there were present Daggett,
Judson and Hayes—the worst characters in
the camp. While Larkin remained beside me to
threaten me with his pistol, the others spread out
a blanket and dumped into it every sack of gold
I possessed. This they secured by tying the corners
of the blanket together. Next they spread
another blanket and threw into it a quantity of
canned meats and other provisions, afterwards
tying them up as they had the gold. Then Hayes
took the pistol and stood guard over me while
the others crept from the hut. They were back
in a few minutes, however, bearing another blanket
heavily loaded. And now Larkin resumed his
place beside me and the others caught up the three
parcels and after extinguishing the candle slipped
out of the doorway. There was a moon outside,
I knew, but it was quite dark in the hut, and the
consciousness of being at the mercy of the
scoundrel beside me sent cold shivers creeping up
my spine.</p>

<p class='c009'>After waiting a few moments in silence Larkin
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look a-here, Sam,” he said gruffly, but in a
low voice, “we’ve took some gold and other stuff,
as ye know; but we ain’t goin’ to do murder unless
we has to. If you’ve got sense enough to
keep still for a solid hour, an’ make no fuss, you’ll
live to get as much gold, or more, as we’ve just
grabbed. But if you try to raise the camp, or foller
us, I’ll kill you before you know it. Now, I’m
goin’ to stand outside the door for a solid hour—you
lay still an’ count sixty seconds to a minute
an’ sixty minutes to an hour. If you move before
that, you’re a dead one; after the hour ye
can howl all ye please, and the louder the better.
I ought to stick a knife into you now; but I guess
I’ll wait outside the door, an’ see if you mind
what I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then with a threatening flourish of his pistol,
he slunk away, and as soon as he was outside the
door I rose up and followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I knew he was lying, well enough, and that his
threats were merely meant to terrify me into keeping
silent until he escaped. He considered me a
mere boy, and believed I would be too frightened
to cause him any trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>But where could he and his fellow thieves go?
How could they penetrate the wild thicket? That
was the question that puzzled me. And then I
remembered that Daggett was with them, who
was reputed to be able to travel at will throughout
the interior of the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I reached the door and looked around
I could at first see no signs of the man who had
just left me. Then I discovered a dark form
creeping along the edge of the jungle, and at once
I sprang into the shade myself and crept after
him. He was going slowly, and in my eagerness
I closed up most of the distance between us, until
I was dangerously near. But he did not look
around, and while my eyes were fastened upon
him he dropped to his knees, pushed aside a thick
bush, and disappeared into the thicket.</p>

<p class='c009'>That was all the information I wanted, just
then; so I hastily marked the place by heaping a
mound of sand before the bush, and then ran back
to my hut as fast as I could go. I was terribly
humiliated at being robbed so coolly of the gold
that had been placed in my care, and rashly resolved
that I would recover it by my own efforts,
without disturbing the slumbers of my uncle or
the Major. So, entering the hut, I secured three
revolvers, of the Colt type, and several boxes of
cartridges for them, all of which I had secretly
smuggled from the ship and hidden among the
groceries, for the Major had forbidden any of our
crew having fire-arms. I had thought that an
emergency might arise, some time, when these
revolvers would be useful to us, and now I blessed
my foresight in secreting them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having secured the weapons I ran quickly
to the hut of Nux and Bryonia, and cautiously
awakened them. At my first touch Bry sprang
into the air and alighted on his feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s matter, Mars Sam?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve been robbed, Bry!” I panted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Robbed!” echoed Nux, who was now beside
us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; Larkin and his gang have taken every
bag of our dust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Through the dim light I could see their white
eyeballs glaring at me in amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you goin’ do, Mars Sam?” asked
Bry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to give chase, and make the rascals
give it back. That is, if you will be my
friends, and stand by me,” I said. “By daybreak
every bag must be in my hut again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure ’nough,” murmured Nux.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We ready, Mars Sam,” announced Bry,
quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then take these revolvers, and follow me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave a weapon to each, having hastily loaded
them; and then I turned away, followed by the
dark forms of the two Sulus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re thieves, you know; burglars and
outlaws,” I said. “So if we have to shoot them
down, no one can blame us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They made no answer to this remark, and
soon we had left the camp behind and reached
the bush underneath which Larkin had disappeared.
In a low voice I related what I had seen,
and Bryonia, who was a master of woodcraft, at
once dropped to his knees and vanished into the
thicket. I followed closely after him, and Nux
brought up the rear. After creeping a few paces
through the underbrush Bry grasped my hand
and raised me to my feet, and I discovered that
we were now in a well-defined but narrow path
which allowed us to stand upright.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was dark as pitch in the grim forest, and
we could only feel our way along; but it was not
possible for us to get off the path, which had
doubtless been cut by Daggett to afford his entrance
into the interior of the island, and if our
progress was slow those whom we pursued could
not proceed at much greater speed themselves;
so we crept along, stumbling over roots and tearing
our clothes by brushing against the briars on
either side, for a period of nearly an hour. Bryonia
glided before us as stealthily as a panther,
and often I was not certain but that he had left
us far behind; but Nux made as much noise as I
did, and puffed much harder to get his breath,
so I did not fear being abandoned in the black
wilderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ground seemed to rise gradually as we
penetrated into the wild interior, but the path remained
as narrow as at first. Now that my first
excitement and indignation had cooled, this midnight
pursuit began to look doubtful of result.
The robbers knew the way much better than we
did, and they were so far ahead of us that we
heard no sound of any sort to guide us. More
than once I was tempted to abandon the chase,
for my folly in undertaking it grew more and
more evident; but the two blacks had no thought
of turning back, and I was ashamed to call a halt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly I ran plump into Bryonia, who
grasped my arm as firmly as if it were in a
vise, and held me rigid. Nux immediately ran
into me, but stopped short at the moment of contact.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Bry?” I asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look!” he answered, and swung me around
in front of him. Then, as I peered into the darkness,
a faint ray of light became visible. In a
moment I perceived that it was growing bigger
and brighter, and then I knew what it meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve gone into camp, and lit a fire!” said
I, pleased to have overtaken them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey do’n’ know we’s coming,” chuckled
Nux, from behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bry stood like a statue, holding fast to
my shoulders and peering over my head at the
enemy. We could now see that the forest was
much thinner here than at the point we had entered,
and just beyond, in a little hollow where
Larkin and his men were encamped, the trees
grew quite scattered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our best plan,” said I, after a moment’s
thought, “will be to creep up to them and make a
sudden attack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One, two, free, fou’,” counted Bry, in his
deep voice. “No use to ’tack, Mars Sam. Dey
got guns, an’ kill us all quick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have our revolvers,” I suggested, rather
disappointed at his prediction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nux an’ I <i>might</i> hit somefin’, an’ we might
not,” said Bry. “If we hit somefin’ it might be
a man, an’ it might not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was discouraging, and it called to mind
the fact that I was not much used to fire-arms
myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still, I don’t mean to go back without doing
something to recover our gold,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait!” whispered the black, and swung me
around back of him again. How he managed this
I do not know, for the path was very narrow.
Next moment he disappeared, as if the earth had
swallowed him up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux gave a laugh, and sat down upon the
ground. After a few moments I followed suit,
squatting in the place I had been standing, for
even from that distance I could see by the flickering
firelight the dim forms of the robbers gathered
around it.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now I perceived that Bry’s decision was
wise. We were too far from camp to expect assistance
in case of an emergency, even if our
friends succeeded in finding the entrance to the
jungle that was so cleverly concealed under the
bush. So whatever was to be done must be done
by ourselves—a boy and two black men against
four desperate and well-armed villains, who would
stop at no crime to retain the gold they had stolen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Evidently they did not fear pursuit now, for
we could hear the murmur of their voices as they
laughed and shouted at one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>We waited in silence for a long time, and as
the gloom of the silent forest became intensified
by the distant light I began to feel for the first
time a thrill that was akin to fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally I noticed a black body wriggling its
way toward us through the brush like some huge
snake, and a moment later Bryonia stood before
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I creep close an’ hear what dey say, Mars
Sam,” he reported. “Dey goin’ watch all night.
I watch, too. Tomorrow maybe we catch ’em.
You an’ Nux go sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I protested at once that I was not sleepy; but
Bry led us away from the path to a quiet place
where he had found a bank of moss, and here he
cautioned us to remain quietly. He himself crept
once again toward the camp fire, and a moment
later was wholly invisible. Nux whispered to me
tales of Bryonia’s skill as a woodsman, wherein it
seemed he had excelled in his native land; but
they grew monotonous, in time, and before I
knew it I had fallen fast asleep on the mossy bank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />THE ROCKING-STONE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>When I opened my eyes it was broad daylight,
and at first I could not remember where I was.
But as I sat up I saw before me Nux and Bryonia,
seated calmly side by side, with the wilderness all
around me and the distant voices of the robbers
echoing faintly in my ears. The sun was up, for
I could see it glinting through the trees; so, as a
recollection of my surroundings came back to me,
I asked Bry what was going on.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said the men were breaking camp, having
slept late, and that presently they were going to
travel still further into the interior. I could not
imagine what they had in view, or where they
expected to hide from the vengeance of the men
they had plundered; but Bry declared we could
follow them without ourselves being seen, so I
decided not to give up until we had tracked them
to their hiding place—if, indeed, they had one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently we could see them tramping away
to the southward, carrying the gold and provisions
they had tied up in the blankets. There
must have been two or three hundredweight of
the gold, so the packages were heavy, and they
had to take turns carrying them. But men seldom
feel overburdened by the weight of gold, so we
heard no complaints from the bearers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry went on alone, hiding behind rocks and
trees but keeping the men well in sight. After
him trailed Nux, keeping Bry in sight; and then,
as far away as I dared, I followed Nux, trying to
imitate the example of the blacks and to hide
myself as well as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before noon I grew hungry, for we had
brought no provisions of any sort with us. The
robbers paused to lunch, and then went on; but,
although I searched carefully, I could not find a
morsel of food that they had cast aside. Of water
there was plenty, for we crossed several small
streams; but food began to be more precious than
gold to me, and I vaguely wondered if I should
die of starvation before I got back to camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>At evening the men made camp again, this
time in a little clearing strewn with fallen logs;
and when Bry rejoined me in a clump of trees
where Nux and I had halted, I told him frankly
that I was faint with hunger, and that unless I
could find something to eat I could not go on. I
have no doubt the blacks were hungry, too; but
they were more inured to hardship, and could
bear it better.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bry volunteered to try to secure some
food, and as soon as darkness had fallen he crept
toward the camp, managing to approach to within
five yards of the camp fire, around which the robbers
sat smoking and talking. He was concealed
by a huge log, behind which he hid, listening carefully
to the conversation, which he afterward retailed
to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So far,” Larkin was saying, “we couldn’t
have done better. By this time I guess we’re
pretty safe from pursuit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one could find their way here in a year,”
boasted Daggett, his lean face grinning with delight.
“I’m the only man on the island as knows
the trails.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure you can lead us to that queer
rock you tell of?” asked Judson, a little uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure. And once there, we could defy an
army,” returned Daggett. “Then we can make
our raft, row out to where the ship is, and sail
away home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Larkin gave a rude laugh, ending it with an
oath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’ll be some tall cussin’ in the camp,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Major’ll be crazy,” assented Daggett.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I swiped every grain o’ gold he had, while
he lay a-snorin’,” chuckled Hayes, a big ruffian
who was called “Dandy Pete,” in derision, because
he was so rough and unkempt. “Pity we
couldn’t ’a’ got all there was in camp.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s enough to make us all rich, my boys,
anyhow,” remarked Larkin. “It’s nearly broke
my back, luggin’ of it, an’ there’s only four of us
to divide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this they seemed to grow thoughtful, and
all sat silently smoking for several minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What bothers me,” said Judson, breaking the
silence, “is how we’re to get that blasted ship into
some civilized port. There ain’t a man here as
knows anything about sailin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right,” said Larkin, confidently.
“The sun rises in the east, don’t it? Well, all
we’ve got to do is h’ist the sails and let the wind
blow us towards the east. Some time or other
we’ll get to the American continent, and then we
can run down the coast to ’Frisco. It’s no
trouble to sail a ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got to get away, somehow,” grumbled
Judson, “or our gold won’t be of any use to us.
When are we going to divide?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we get on the ship,” said Daggett,
promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we’re at sea will be better,” added
Larkin.</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at one another suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s got to be a fair divvy,” said Dandy Pete,
with an oath, “or else there won’t be so many to
divide up with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean by that?” demanded
Larkin, angrily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean I’ll stick a knife in your ribs, if you
try any trickery with me,” replied Pete, scowling.
“You made the terms yourself, and you’ve got
to live up to ’em. It’s a quarter each, all around.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s wrong!” yelled Daggett, springing to
his feet. “I’m to have a third, for guiding you.
If it hadn’t been for me, you couldn’t get away
with the gold at all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who promised you a third?” asked Hayes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Larkin.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let Larkin make it up to you, out of
his own share. I’m going to have a quarter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so am I,” said Judson, fingering his revolver.</p>

<p class='c009'>Larkin glared at them with a white face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We won’t quarrel about it, boys,” he said,
after a time. “There’s plenty for all, and we must
hang together till we’re out of danger. I’ll take
what you think is right, for my share.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take my third, an’ no less,” growled Daggett.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one looked at him. Each seemed to be
busy with his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bryonia had chosen this especial log to hide
behind, because the robbers had placed their sack
of provisions upon it. While listening to the conversation
I have recorded, the black had stealthily
reached up his hand and managed to extract from
the bundle a tin of corned beef and a handful of
ship’s biscuits. Then he wriggled carefully away,
and in a few minutes had rejoined Nux and me,
where we hid among the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think no food has ever tasted quite so delicious
to me as did that tinned beef and stale
biscuit. When divided amongst three there was
little enough in each share, but it sufficed to allay
our hunger and give us fresh strength and courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>After we had eaten, Bry decided to go back
again for more, since another opportunity to purloin
from the bundle of provisions might not be
offered us.</p>

<p class='c009'>As it was very dark by this time, Nux and I
crept nearer, to where a big rock lay; and here,
hidden by the deep shadows, we were able to
distinguish clearly all that transpired around the
camp fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry being between us and the light, we could
follow his creeping form with our eyes until we
saw him lying safely hidden behind the log, with
the bundle of food just over him. By this time all
the robbers had lain down to sleep except Larkin,
who had taken the watch and sat moodily smoking
beside the fire, on which he tossed now and then
a handful of fuel.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, as he looked toward the sack that
rested upon the log, he saw it move. In an instant
a pistol shot rang out, and the robbers
sprang to their feet with cries of alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somebody’s behind that log!” shouted Larkin,
who was himself trembling with fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>At once Bryonia arose to his feet, stepped
over the log, and calmly advanced into the light
of the fire, holding out his hand in greeting and
smiling broadly into the angry faces confronting
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’ shoot poor Bry,” he said, pleadingly.
“I’se run ’way to j’ine you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run away!” exclaimed Larkin, while the
others looked at the black suspiciously. “Why
did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So’s I won’ haf to work any mo’,” answered
Bry. “Dey’s jest killin’ me in dat camp, luggin’
bags o’ sand an’ washin’ gold all day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who came with you?” asked Daggett.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nobody ’t all,” declared Bry. “I seen yo’
all leave de camp, an’ so I crep’ along after yo’.
Wouldn’t have let yo’ know I was here, sure
’nough, but I got so hungry. I couldn’t stand
it no longer, so I tried to steal somefin’ to eat, an’
Mars Larkin he shot de gun at me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you know we had quit the camp for
good?” enquired Pete, in a surly tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saw you take de gold, suh. So I ’pects you
ain’t comin’ back agin’, an’ thought I’d jine yo’.
If you’ll take me ’long an’ feed me, Mars Hayes,
I’ll help tote de gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bryonia’s statement was so simple that the
miners were inclined to believe him. Nux and
I, who had crawled nearer to the fire when the
pistol shot rang out, could hear distinctly every
word, and for a moment I was horrified that Bry
should prove false and desert to the enemy. But
Nux was chuckling gleefully, and whispered:
“Dat Bry, he mighty clever boy, Mars Sam!” So
I began to comprehend that Bry was acting a
part, with the idea of saving Nux and me from
discovery and ultimately recovering the gold.
Therefore I kept silent and listened eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Evidently the miners were not of one opinion
concerning the new arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s kill the nigger,” said Daggett. “Then
we won’t run any chances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be a fool,” retorted Larkin. “Bry can
be useful to us. He’s the cook of the ‘Flipper’,
I’m told, and besides helping to carry the gold, he
can cook our meals when we get to sea, and help
sail the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he’s run away from camp, why, he’s one
of us,” said Judson, yawning and sitting down
again. “And if it comes to a fight, he counts for
one more on our side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he don’t get any gold,” added Dandy
Pete.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not an ounce!” declared Daggett.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t want any gold,” said Bry, composedly.
“Only want to get away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” decided Larkin. “You can come
along. But you’ve got to obey orders, and the
first time I catch you at any tricks, I’ll put a bullet
into you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry grinned from ear to ear, as if he considered
this a good joke, and then he warmed his
hands over the fire while Judson brought him
something to eat from the bundle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward all lay down to sleep again except
Larkin, who resumed his watch. It was too soon
to put any trust in Bry, so the black, having eaten
his fill, lay down beside the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux and I cautiously retreated to the rock,
and consulted as to what we should do under these
circumstances. The black man had perfect confidence
in his comrade, and proposed that we
should still follow the band of robbers and wait
for Bry to find a way to communicate with us and
assist us. This seemed reasonable to me, also.</p>

<p class='c009'>As we were chilled to the bones in the cold
night air, Nux suggested that we go into camp
until morning, and led me a long distance back
into the woods, where we finally came to a deep
hollow. Here there would be little danger that a
fire could be seen by the robbers; so we gathered
together some twigs, and as I had matches in
my pocket a fire was soon started that proved
very grateful to us both. We then agreed to take
turns watching until daylight, and while Nux
lay down to sleep I took the first watch. But in
some way—perhaps because the fire was so cosy
and agreeable,—I gradually lost consciousness,
and when morning came both Nux and I awoke
with a start to find the fire out and the sun glinting
brightly through the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>We made all haste toward the camp of the
robbers, but when we arrived at the place we
found it deserted. They could not have been
gone long, however, for the embers of the fire
were still aglow; and Nux, who was keen as a
bloodhound on a trail, declared he would have no
trouble in following the band.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before we left, however, we made a search
for food, and to our joy discovered behind the
log a can of beans and some more biscuits, which
Bry had evidently found an opportunity to hide
there for our benefit. We began the chase even
while we ate, for Nux picked out the trail with
ease and threaded his way between the trees with
absolute confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly noon when he halted suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had come to the edge of the forest. Before
us lay a broad table-land, barren of any trees
or brush whatever, and beyond this strip of rock
the blue sea stretched away to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, we’ve crossed the island!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only one end of de island,” corrected Nux.
“De bay where our ship lays ain’t half a mile
away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It surprised me that the shrewd black should
know this, but I did not question his statement.
Just now my attention was drawn to the robbers,
who had halted upon the further edge of the
table-land, which even from where we stood,
could be seen to form a high bluff above the
ocean. At this place it ran out into a little point,
and just beyond this point, but separated from
the mainland by a wide gulf, stood an island-like
peak of rock, its flat surface on a level with the
bluff. It must at one time have formed a part of
the mainland, but some convulsion of nature had
broken it away, and now a deep fissure isolated it
from the bluff.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature was responsible for two other curious
freaks. One was a group of tall pines, three in
number, which grew on the separate peak where
there seemed scarcely enough soil covering the
rock to hold the roots of the trees. Yet on the
main bluff there were no trees at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other phenomenon was a great rock, that
must have weighed thousands of tons, which lay
upon the edge of the bluff so nicely balanced that
it almost seemed as if a good push would precipitate
it into the gulf below. It was triangular
in shape, and the base rested on the bluff
while its outer point projected far over the gulf
till it towered almost above the isolated point of
rock I have described.</p>

<p class='c009'>The robbers, when we first saw them, were
engaged in earnest consultation. It appeared that
Daggett was explaining something about the
great rock, for he pointed toward it several times,
and then at the islet. The others leaned over the
edge of the gulf, looked into the chasm below, at
the triangular rock, at the barren islet, and then
drew back and shook their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Daggett, whom I had always considered
a coward, did what struck me as being a very
brave act. He climbed upon the sloping rock, and
gradually crept upward on his hands and knees.
When he reached a point above the center the
huge rock began to tremble. Daggett crept a little
further along, and now the entire mass of rock,
which was poised to a nicety, raised its vast bulk
and tipped slowly outward. Daggett slid forward;
the point of rock under him touched the islet
and came to rest, and then he leaped off and
stood safely upon the peak, while the rocking-stone,
relieved of his weight, slowly returned to
its former position.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cheer went up from the men, and they hesitated
no longer. Bry crept up the stone next,
and was tipped gracefully upon the islet. One
after another Hayes, Judson and Larkin mounted
the rocking-stone and were deposited upon the
rocky point, together with their bundles of gold
and provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>We could not see very well what became of
them, after this, for the big rock hid them from
our view; but as it was evident they could not
get back again—at least by the same means they
had employed to reach the islet,—Nux and I made
bold to creep out of our shelter and approach the
point that jutted outward into the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, to our surprise, we saw that the flat
top of the rock was deserted. The robbers, together
with Bry and the treasure, seemed to have
vanished into thin air!</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />THE CAVERN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>From our better position we could now see
the sides of the great rock which reared itself
nearly a hundred feet from the shore and stood
like some gigantic, flat topped obelisk, keeping
guard by the lonely sea. Some ancient convulsion
of nature, such an earthquake or a lightning
bolt, had evidently split it from the main
precipice of rock near which it stood; for the huge
crevice that separated it, and which extended entirely
down to the beach, almost followed its outlines
in every particular. But what had cast up
that great rocking-stone, and placed it in so finely
balanced a position that it could be made a curious
but effective bridge to the isolated peak? No
one can tell. Another freak of nature, doubtless,
for no mortal hands could ever have moved so
great a weight of solid rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now was solved the problem of the mysterious
disappearance of the robbers; for, looking
over the edge, we saw them creeping slowly down
the side of the cliff. A natural ledge, varying
from one to three feet in breadth, led from the
top down to the bottom, circling entirely around
the crag with a sort of corkscrew regularity. It
was a dizzy path, most certainly, and I did not
wonder to see the men cling fast to the inner side
of the rock as they crept down the tortuous ledge;
but Daggett, who evidently knew the place well,
led them fearlessly, and the others followed, dragging
their burdens and the sacks of gold dust as
best they could. I certainly expected to see one
or more of them tumble headlong at any moment;
but no accident happened and presently, as they
descended, the path wound around the opposite
side of the rock, and they were lost to view.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered if I would see them again, and if
it were wise to stick to my exposed post of observation;
but while I pondered the matter Daggett
came into view again, having passed around
the rock. He was now two thirds of the way to
the sands, and as he followed the ledge on the inner
side, that lay next the face of the main cliff,
I saw him suddenly pause upon a broader part
of the path than the rest, and then disappear into
the rock itself—or so it seemed to my gaze from
where I watched. One by one the men came after
him, and one by one the rock swallowed them
up with their burdens; and now passed a period
of tedious waiting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Nux and I had counted the fugitives and
saw that all had safely descended to this point,
including Bry. But what had become of them now
was a mystery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall we do, Nux?” I asked in indecision.
“There’s nothing more to be seen from
here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The black, whose eyes held a startled expression,
made no reply; but he crept with me to a
nearer and better position at the edge of the cliff
beside the rocking-stone, and together we peered
over into the abyss. Now, indeed, the strange
disappearance of the robbers was explained, for
from our present point or vantage we could see
a black spot far down on the inner face of the
column of rock, where the ledge passed, and this
spot was evidently a cavity into which the men
had penetrated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All we can do now,” I said, with a sigh of
regret, “is to wait until they come out. It would
be foolish to follow them into that place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux nodded an emphatic approval, and we
proceeded to lie down upon our faces, so that our
eyes just projected over the edge of the cliff, and
in this position we watched as patiently as we
could for something to happen.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was fully an hour before the men reappeared.
A distant sound of voices, raised high in
angry dispute, was the first token that the desperadoes
were quitting the interior of the rock. Then
Larkin and Daggett came out and stood upon the
ledge, the others crowding behind them on the
narrow footing, while their guide pointed along
the ledge that still continued to lead downward.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were without burdens now, either of
provisions or gold dust; but the two axes were
carried over Bry’s shoulder, and another man bore
a coil of rope.</p>

<p class='c009'>They seemed to be disputing together about
something, and a few of the words reached our
ears. Daggett was urging them to follow a plan
he had proposed, while some of the others demurred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s too hot to work,” we heard one of the
men declare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not too hot to hang,” shouted Daggett,
in reply, “and you’ll hang, every mother’s son
of you, if we don’t get to the ship!”</p>

<p class='c009'>That seemed to be an effective argument, for
after a few more words of protest the men followed
Daggett along the ledge, Bry coming last
of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>The path was broader from there on, and
they made rapid progress, soon being again lost
to our view around the rock. Just as Bry disappeared
he looked up and saw Nux and me
eagerly watching from above. For an instant he
paused to wave his hand and grin at us reassuringly;
then he passed around the edge and vanished
after the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat Bry don’ ’pear to be much scared,” said
Nux, in an encouraged tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” I answered, thoughtfully. “He’s got
some plan in his head, I’m sure, to help us. But
where have the men gone now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux could not answer this problem, but after
a few moments it solved itself, for the robbers and
Bry appeared upon the sandy shore, close to the
water, and walked briskly along the narrow strip
of beach between the lapping waves and the grim
precipice of the mainland. It was not long before
a bend in the coast hid them completely, and then
we sat up and looked at one another inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What we do now?” asked the black.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go down the rock,” I suggested, assuming
to be braver than I really was. “They’ve
left the gold behind them, that’s sure; and the
gold is what we’re after, Nux. Once we have
recovered that, it doesn’t matter so much what
becomes of the thieves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’ dey come back?” enquired Nux, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not,” said I, truthfully. “At least not
until after we’ve got back the gold. But there’s
no time to lose. Follow me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having thus assumed the leadership, I strove
to banish all unmanly fear and boldly sprang on
to the end of the rocking-stone that rested on the
mainland. Slowly and with caution I crept up
its incline until I was directly over the gulf. It
was now that the stone should tip, but it seemed
that my weight, being less than that of any of the
men who had passed over, was not sufficient to
balance the rock, so it began to look like a risky
thing for me to climb further up the tapering
point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s got to be done,” I muttered to myself,
setting my teeth firmly together; and then,
summoning what courage I possessed, I lay close
to the rock and crawled steadily upward, digging
my toes desperately into the irregular hollows of
the surface, to keep from sliding into the gulf that
yawned below. Higher and higher I climbed, and
at last the huge rock trembled and then gently
sank beneath me. For a moment I was exultant;
but I had crept so near to the slippery point
of the wedge that I could find no rough projection
to grasp with my fingers, and therefore as
soon as my head became lower than my feet I
slid headforemost to the point and tumbled off
before the rocking-stone had reached a point of
rest upon the peak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fortunately, however, I had been carried over
the gulf, and although I lay, half-stunned, upon
the very edge of the great precipice, I was not
much hurt. In another moment I managed to
drag myself to a position of greater safety, while
the rocking-stone, relieved of my weight, reared
its nearest point into the air again and fell slowly
back into its original position.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux, who had watched breathlessly my adventure
and hair-breadth escape, was trembling
violently when he in turn mounted the stone. But
I called out to reassure him, and his greater weight
caused the wedge to tip more quickly, so that he
effected the passage to the rocky peak with comparative
ease.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once beside me the faithful fellow began rubbing
my limbs briskly to renew their circulation
and ease the bruises, and it was not long before
I felt sufficiently restored to announce my resolve
to continue the adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Nux,” said I, scrambling to my
feet, “we must get that gold before Daggett and
his gang come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The black was staring at the rocking-stone,
now removed from our table-like refuge by a good
twenty feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How we get back again?” he asked, in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” said I. “That’s a question
we’ll have to face afterward. The main thing is
to get the gold, and it’s certain that if we can
find no way to escape the robbers will be as badly
off themselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dat won’ help us, Mars Sam,” he said,
gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>But already I was engaged in eagerly peering
over the edge of the peak to find the ledge by
which the men had descended, and in an instant
I discovered it. It started with a projection
scarcely six inches wide, which lay nearly four
feet from the top, and it is small wonder that I
looked at it dubiously, at first. For if I let myself
over, and missed my footing, I would be
tumbled sheer down the face of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I go first,” decided Nux, who had also
glanced over the cliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a crack in the rock, near the edge,
which afforded him a hold for his hands, and
clutching this the black let his body slide over
until his feet touched the projection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mars Sam,” he said. “You hold on
me, an’ come down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This I quickly did, and found the feat much
less difficult than I had feared. Just at the top
where my companion’s feet rested, there was sufficient
incline to enable me to lean against the
rock, and a few steps further on the ledge widened
until the path was quite easy to follow.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went first, followed closely by the black, and
although it was not a descent one would have
chosen for a pleasure excursion there was little
of danger to be encountered by those with cool
heads and determined hearts, such as we strove
to maintain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Round and round the great pillar of rock we
crept, nearing the foot gradually until we came at
last to the side facing the main cliff and found
the opening of a large cavern beside us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Filled with eager curiosity I took a step or
two inside, and found the cavern to be fully ten
feet in height and about fifteen feet in depth.
There was no light except that which came
through the round entrance, and as this faced the
side of the cliff it was so shadowed that it required
a few moments for me to accustom my eyes to the
gloom, so that I could see plainly the interior of
the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Its floor was strewn deeply with sand, an evidence
that when the waves rolled high they rebounded
from the face of the cliff and deposited
their sand in the cavern. The marks of numerous
footprints, however, were all that could be seen
in the cave, and it did not take me a moment to
guess what had occupied the robbers so long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’ve buried the sacks of gold and the provisions
under the sand!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure ’nough,” agreed Nux.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will take us some time to dig for them, for
we don’t know exactly where to look,” I continued,
reflectively, “so our best plan will be to go
down to the beach and discover what has become
of Daggett and his crew, and whether they’re
liable to come back here before night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The black readily agreed to this, so we at
once left the cave and continued along the ledge
until we reached the sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The path became quite broad in this part, and
our descent was therefore concluded very rapidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once on the shore we walked briskly along
until we had turned the bend in the beach, which
curved to follow the lines of a little bay. Here
we paused, for a long stretch of the beach was
now opened to our gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>From this point the shore widened out, for
the precipitous mainland shrank backward and
decreased gradually in height until, a half mile
or so further on, it reached the level plain and
merged into a deep forest which grew almost
down to the edge of the sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>No human being was in sight, so we naturally
concluded that the robbers had entered the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being curious to discover what they were doing,
without hesitation we decided to follow them,
and their path was easily traced by the footprints
in the sand. These led straight to the forest, and
although somewhat fearful that the enemy would
discover our presence, we proceeded to walk boldly
around the shore of the little bay until we came
to the edge of the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sound of voices, mingled with the strokes
of the axes, now guided us, and stealthily creeping
among the thick underbrush we soon discovered
the robbers busily at work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Judson and Dandy Pete were trimming the
branches from a fallen tree-trunk, while the others
were rolling and dragging another big log
toward the sea, the glistening waters being perceptible
but a few yards away. Evidently the
men were intending to build a raft, and after
listening for a few minutes to their disjointed conversation
we learned that the raft was designed
to convey them and their stolen wealth to the
ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>While Daggett, Larkin and Bry tugged and
dragged at the log, Nux and I crept away to the
shore, where we found two big logs already lying
upon the sands. Also we could now plainly
see, sheltered in another bay, the “Flipper” lying
quietly at her anchorage, as Nux had wisely predicted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The schemes of the robbers were now fully
explained. Under cover of the forest by day,
and hidden in their cave by night, they intended
to complete the raft, and when it was ready it
would not be difficult to steal away to the ship
with the treasure, under cover of darkness, hoist
the sails, and creep out to sea, bidding defiance to
the Major and his comrades and leaving the
miners and the “Flipper’s” crew to perish on the
lonely island.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the construction of the raft would require
time—several days, at least—for after getting
the logs to the shore they must be fastened together
by cross-strips secured with wooden pegs,
since there was not enough rope in their possession
to bind the tree-trunks together.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more returning to a part of the underbrush
near which the men were employed, Nux
and I settled ourselves to listen attentively to their
conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently we heard Daggett say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“At this rate we’ll have the raft ready by Saturday,
and Saturday night we’ll take the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s beastly hard work!” growled Dandy
Pete, brushing with his sleeve the sweat from his
brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but it means liberty and riches to every
one of us,” said Daggett, and that was an argument
none cared to deny.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then I was startled at hearing low voices
just beside me and instinctively I touched the
black’s shoulder and we crouched lower in the
bushes. Nux, indeed, with a woodsman’s instinct,
was quite flat upon the ground, lifeless and invisible,
and I strove to imitate him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s as easy as can be,” said the voice, which
I recognized as that of Larkin. “We’ll let the
fools work until the raft is finished, and then
we’ll put our knives in their hearts, and have the
gold for ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about Bry?” asked Judson, hoarsely
whispering to his murderous comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he won’t interfere any,” was the reply.
“And we need the nigger to help us work the
ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can three of us manage the vessel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course, with good weather. We’ll have
to take our chances of a storm, but the fewer
there are to divide up, the bigger our fortunes
will be. We won’t give the nigger a cent, but go
halves on the whole thing. Perhaps we can sell
the ship, too, for a good sum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right; I’m with you!” declared Judson,
with an oath; and then the two conspirators crept
away and rejoined the others, unconscious that
their diabolical plot had been overheard.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />WE RECOVER THE GOLD.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Thinking over the matter, I decided to return
at once to the cave. The thieves would doubtless
be occupied in the forest until sundown, and such
a chance as this to secure possession of the gold
might never occur again. For if Daggett or his
men chanced to see our footprints in the sand, or
suspected they were being spied upon, they would
be liable to leave a guard in the cave thereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>So we softly crept from the forest and made
our way back by the same route we had come, taking
care to tread in the trail made by the robbers,
so that our footprints could be less easily distinguished.
We did not feel entirely safe from observation
until we had regained the column of
rock which towered into the air beside the precipitous
cliff; but once our feet were on the narrow
ledge both I and my faithful Sulu breathed easier,
and with more deliberation accomplished the ascent
to the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said I, “we must work carefully, so
that no spot of sand can escape us; for the thieves
have taken care to disturb the surface everywhere,
in order to throw any chance visitor to this hiding-place
off the track. But we know the gold
is buried in this cave, Nux, so it ought not to be
a very hard job to find it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux nodded, with his usual complaisance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We begin in back,” he suggested, “and work
front.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This seemed sensible, so I followed the black
to the far end of the cavern, and falling upon our
knees we immediately began digging with our
hands into the soft sand.</p>

<p class='c009'>For nearly an hour we steadily worked, finding
nothing at all. Then, as I stopped to rest, I
cast a careless glance along the rocky sides of the
cave and thought that I saw a white mark upon
the wall, a few feet toward the front. Springing
to my feet I approached this point and discovered
that a small cross had been made with a piece of
chalk or a bit of white limestone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here we are, Nux!” I cried, joyfully and
at once began digging in the sand beneath the
mark. A few minutes work proved that my sudden
suspicion was correct; for Nux, who had
straightway joined me, dragged one of the sacks
to light, while I discovered another just beside it.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was part of the stolen gold, sure enough,
and my heart beat fast with excitement as I realized
that the precious hoard was once more in my
possession.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only a part had been hidden in this place, we
found; but now we had an unmistakeable clew to
guide us, so that we had little difficulty in finding
a second secret mark that resulted in the discovery
of the balance of the treasure, as well as the
sacks of provisions.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all had been unearthed Nux asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What we do now, Mars Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, carry it away, of course,” I answered,
joyous and elate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?” enquired the black, simply.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked at him in surprise, and then realizing
the meaning of the question, grew thoughtful
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re right, Nux,” said I. “It’s going to
be a harder task than I thought. We can’t pass
by the forest with it, that’s certain; for Daggett
and his followers would be sure to see us. On the
other side, the cliff rises straight out of the sea,
and there’s no way to escape around it. All we
can do, then, is to carry the gold to the top of this
rock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hm!” grunted the Sulu. “Dat no good,
Mars Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No way to get off top of rock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True; but we can hide there, ’till the thieves
go away to the ship. It isn’t likely they’ll climb
up there again, for this cave is a better place to
sleep in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux seemed unconvinced, and I had none too
much confidence in my own assertion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tonight,” said the black, in a dismal tone,
“dey hunt for de gold. All gone. Robber very
mad. Dey look ev’rywhere; den dey find us on
rock. Den dey kill us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a pretty tough prophecy, Nux,” I
returned, as cheerfully as I could. “And it sounds
likely enough, I confess. We’ve got the gold
again, to be sure; but the robbers have got us; so
we’re worse off than we were before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux took a lump of bread from a provision
sack and begun to munch it leisurely. Noticing
the action, and remembering that I also was hungry,
I proceeded to follow the black’s example.</p>

<p class='c009'>While we ate, however, my Sulu was busily
thinking, and so was I. As a result I presently
gave my leg a delighted slap and began to laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux looked at me with a grin of sympathy upon
his black features.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s matter, Mars Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nux,” said I, checking my amusement and
trying to look grave and impressive, “there’s an
old saying that ‘there’s never a lock so strong but
there’s a key to fit it’. In other words, while
there’s life there’s hope; never give up the ship;
every sky has a silver lining!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s a lovely pair of trousers you’re wearing,
Nux,” I continued, in a jocular strain.
“They’re made of the stoutest cloth Uncle Naboth
could find in San Francisco, and I gave them to
you out of the ship’s stores only three or four
days ago, because your old ones were so ragged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux glanced at his wide-legged blue trousers
and nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, old man,” said I, “you’ve often told
me you used to go bare-legged and bare-backed in
your own island, so I’m going to ask you to go
bare-legged a little while now, and lend me those
trousers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wha’ for, Mars Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To put the gold grains in, of course. The
robbers may look for the sacks of gold, when they
come back, but they’re pretty sure not to open
them. Therefore, my friend we’ll fix it so that
they’ll think their gold is all safe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, Mars Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By filling the sacks with sand, and burying
them again where we found them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux looked at me admiringly, and grinned until
his mouth stretched from ear to ear and displayed
everyone of his white teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good, Mars Sam!” he cried, and at once
stripped the trousers from his legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I now hunted in the pockets of my jacket and
brought out several small bits of cord, which I
knotted firmly together. Then I tied the legs
of Nux’s trousers tightly at the bottoms, thus
transforming them into a double sack of great
capacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not take us long to transfer the gold dust
from the canvas bags to the trouser-legs, and
as soon as this task was accomplished we refilled
the bags with sand and tied up as before. I was
obliged to tear away a part of my own shirt to
get material with which to tie the upper part of
the trousers, for I did not wish to deprive poor
Nux of his entire apparel. The Sulu looked funny
enough, dressed only in his shoes and shirt, with
his black legs between them, and more than once
I was obliged to pause and laugh heartily at my
comrade’s appearance. But Nux didn’t seem to
mind, and soon the seriousness of our position and
the necessity to hasten caused me to forget the
queer costume of my follower.</p>

<p class='c009'>We abstracted but a slender supply of provisions
from the sacks, for we did not wish to
arouse suspicion by taking too much. The next
task was to bury the sacks of sand and the provisions
exactly as they had been before, and to
smooth over the surface of the sand and trample
it down just as we had found it when we first entered
the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>This being accomplished to our complete satisfaction,
Nux lifted the heavy gold over his
shoulder, one leg hanging behind his back and one
in front, and started to mount the narrow ledge
of rock with his burden, while I followed close
behind to render any assistance I could.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sulu was a wonderfully strong man; but
his task was a difficult one, although I tried to relieve
him in the worst places by lifting a part of
the heavy load.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our progress was slow, for poor Nux had to
stop frequently to put down his load and rest,
and it was while we were on the outer surface of
the rock, which faced the sea, that we were suddenly
startled by hearing sounds that assured
us the robbers were returning from the forest.
Much time had been consumed in the cave, searching
for the treasure and securing it, and now I
began to fear we had delayed too long.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at this time the men could not see us;
but as soon as they mounted the ledge and began
to wind around the tower of rock, they would be
sure to catch sight of our forms, and then our
fate would be sealed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nux,” I whispered, “pick up the gold and be
ready to start. As soon as the thieves get back to
the ledge we must go on, and keep the rock always
between us and them, or we shall be lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux nodded, and obeyed without a word. It
was often hard to tell, by the sound of their voices,
just how far up the ledge the men had progressed;
but fortune favored us, and only once did we lag
behind enough for the first of the robber band to
espy us. But that first person, by good luck,
proved to be Bryonia, and the clever black at once
pretended to stumble and fall, and so held the men
that followed him in check until Nux and I had
escaped around the crag.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after this the robbers reached the cave,
which they entered, thus enabling us to reach the
top of the crag at our leisure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux was nearly spent when at last he threw
the laden trousers upon the flat top and tried to
draw his tired body after them; but I gave him a
hearty boost from behind, and then scrambled to
the top unaided, nerved by the excitement of the
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several minutes neither of us spoke. The
black man lay panting for breath, with the perspiration
streaming from every pore of his body,
and I, filled with gratitude at our escape and the
successful accomplishment of our plan, sat beside
my faithful friend and fanned him with my
straw hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was sinking fast, by this time, and the
shadows of the three tall pine trees that grew upon
this isolated peak fell upon the spot where we
rested, and cooled our sun-parched bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although at times a rough laugh or a shouted
curse reached our ears from the cavern below,
there was no indication that Daggett or his band
had yet made the discovery that the place had
been visited in their absence, and the treasure
for which they had risked so much abstracted
from its sandy grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>When twilight fell I arose and with some difficulty
rolled the trousers to a place nearer the center
of the rock, where there was a small natural
hollow; and then Nux and I sat beside it and ate
again sparingly of the food we had brought.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was while we were thus occupied that an
incident occurred that filled us with sudden panic.
For before our faces a man’s head appeared above
the edge of rock, and two dark eyes glared fixedly
into our own.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the moment I almost screamed with fright,
so unnerved had my recent adventures rendered
me; but Nux laid his broad hand across my mouth
and arrested the outcry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Bry,” he whispered, and even as he spoke
the newcomer drew himself over the edge and
crept on all fours to our side. I had no trouble
in recognizing the friendly features then.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Bry!” I said—softly, so as not to be
heard by the robbers below—and clasped the black
hands fervently in both my own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry squatted beside us, his kindly face
wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey send me up here to see if anyone
’round,” he whispered. “In a minute I go back
and say ‘no.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you stay with us, Bry?” I asked, pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not yet, Mars Sam. Dey very bad mans,
down dere. Dey kill you quick if dey find you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve got the gold, Bry!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know. I see you in the de wood; I follow
your footprints all way home; I see you
climbin’ up rock. Den I see de sand been dig up,
so I knew you got gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did they suspect us at all, Bry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Mars Sam. Dey too busy tryin’ to kill
each other. All want to have gold for himself,
so all try to kill everyone else. Very bad mans,
Mars Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re going to take you on the ship, and
make you sail it,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry laughed, silently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I stay with them now, so they not find you,”
he said. “But when right time come I steal
away an’ come back to you. Did you fill sack
with sand, Mars Sam?” glancing enquiringly at
the stuffed trousers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That good,” said Bry, approvingly. “They
dig up one, when they come back, to see if all
safe. Then they hide it again. Very good way
to fool bad mans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we can’t leave here until they go away,”
I remarked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Must be careful. Tomorrow they finish
raft. Tomorrow night they go to ship. You
stay here and hide till then. After de bad mans
go, I come back to you, and we go to camp again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Bry,” said I, as cheerfully as possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the black bade us good-bye and returned
to the cave to report to Daggett that no one was
to be seen anywhere about. And now Nux and
I, wearied by the adventures of the day, but
buoyed by the hope that we might finally escape
with the recovered gold, lay down upon the rocky
eminence and, bathed by the moon’s silver rays,
slept peacefully until morning.</p>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />THE CATASTROPHE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I was awakened by the voices of the robbers,
who were leaving the cave early in order to complete
their raft by nightfall. It was evident that
they had not suspected our intrusion into their
retreat, or the fact that their stolen treasure had
been taken from them. Indeed, they seemed in
high spirits, especially Larkin and Judson, who
were doubtless eager to carry out their nefarious
plan of murdering their comrades as soon as the
work on the raft was finished. Daggett might
also harbor a conspiracy to secure the bulk of the
treasure, and probably all the members of the
evil band were looking forward to this coming
night to end their suspense and give them an advantage
one over the other. “Honor among
thieves” has often been quoted; but in this instance,
as in many others that could be mentioned,
the thieves were as lacking in honor as they were
in honesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>From my elevated perch I watched them file
along the ledge to the sands, and upon reaching
the level set off toward the forest. Not till they
were well out of sight did Nux or I venture to
rise upright and stretch our limbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning was warm and sultry. The sun
gleamed hot in a cloudless sky and not a breath
of air stirred the leaves of the three tall trees that
stood at the edge of our towering rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s going to be a roasting day,” I said to
Nux, “and we won’t get any shade from those
trees until afternoon. Do you suppose we dare
go down to the cave for a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We all safe now, Mars Sam,” he replied.
“Better not run no risk wid dis yeah gold dust.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thoughtfully I gazed toward the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Those fellows will be cool and comfortable
enough in the shade,” I remarked, rebelliously,
“and I don’t believe they’ll come back through the
hot sun until it’s time to get the treasure. Let’s
go down to the sea and take a swim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux was unable to resist the temptation; so,
leaving the trousers full of golden grains resting
on top of the rock, we made our way cautiously
along the narrow, winding ledge until we
reached the shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was not a ripple on the sea. It lay as
still and inert as a sheet of glass; but the water
was cool, nevertheless, when compared with the
stifling atmosphere, and so I and my black companion
paddled in it for more than an hour, feeling
much refreshed by our luxurious bath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Afterward we ate our simple breakfast and
then climbed the ledge as far as the mouth of the
cave, where we sat down in the shade. Even that
slight exertion quite exhausted us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will be sure to hear them if they should
by chance return,” said I, “and we’ll certainly
be roasted if we get on top of this rock, where the
sun can strike us. I believe it’s the hottest day
I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime the men in the forest were finding
their work far from pleasant, as Bryonia afterward
told us. They were shaded from the sun,
it is true; but the air they breathed was as hot as
if it came fresh from an oven, and the least exertion
caused the perspiration to stream from their
pores. So there was considerable grumbling
among them and a general shirking of work that
made their progress slow. Even Bryonia, who
was fairly heat-proof, found he had little energy
to swing his axe, although he made a pretense of
working as industriously as ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind, boys,” said Daggett, when noon
had arrived and they were eating the luncheon
they had brought in their pockets. “The raft will
be big enough to carry us and the gold to the ship,
I’m sure, for the sea is as still as a mill-pond.
We’ll just get these two logs to the shore, and
fasten them to the others, and call the thing a
go. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They agreed with him readily enough. As a
matter of fact the raft might suffice to carry them
all, but none of them believed that all five would
embark upon it, so many murderous schemes
were lurking in their minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wearily they dragged the two logs toward the
sea, but much time was consumed in this operation,
and the day was far spent before the raft
was complete and ready to launch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the men had stripped themselves
naked, to work more comfortably, for the heat
was well-nigh unbearable; but now, as they stood
ready to push the raft into the water, the sun suddenly
disappeared and a cold chill swept over
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re going to have a storm,” cried Daggett,
looking curiously into the sky. “Better leave the
raft where it is, my lads, and make for the cave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The warning was unquestionable. Already a
low, moaning sound came to their ears across the
sea, and the sky grew darker each moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>With one accord the men seized their clothing
in their arms and ran along the beach toward
the cave, while tiny points of lightning darted
here and there about them, casting weird if momentary
gleams upon their naked forms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux and I sitting half asleep by the mouth of
the cave, were warned by the first chill blast that
swept over us that the weather had changed and
a storm was imminent. Springing to my feet I
looked fearfully at the darkening sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’ll we do, Nux?” I asked. “This will
bring our enemies back here in double-quick
time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better climb on top de rock, Mars Sam,”
advised the Sulu.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’ll rain—floods and torrents, probably—and
thunder and lightning besides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Spect it will, Mars Sam. But rain won’t
hurt us much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Daggett’s gang will, if they catch us.
I guess you’re right, Nux. Come along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As we started along the ledge the wind came
upon us in sudden gusts, and the sky grew so
dark that we almost had to feel our way. It
was necessary to exercise great care, both to find
a secure footing and to cling fast to the face of
the rock, to prevent our being blown into the
abyss below; but we struggled manfully on, and
presently reached the top, where Nux hoisted me
over the edge and then scrambled after me.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time the lightning was playing all
around us, and we were obliged to crawl carefully
on hands and knees to the little hollow in the center
of the rock, where we were to an extent shielded
from the fierce gusts of wind. Even then I
feared we would be blown away; but Nux shouted
in my ear to hold fast to the gold, which served
as a sort of anchor, and enabled us both, as we
lay flat in the hollow, to maintain our positions
securely.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now the lightning began to be accompanied
by sharp peals of thunder, while the wind
suddenly subsided to give place to wild floods of
rain. At intervals could be heard the shouts of
the robbers, who had reached the rocks and were
creeping along the ledge to their cave. All the
elements seemed engaged in a confused turmoil,
until I was nearly deafened by the uproar. I tried
to ask a question of Nux, but could not hear my
own voice, and gave up the attempt. The thought
crossed my mind that we had been very foolish
to climb to this peak of rock, where we were exposed
to the full fury of the storm, and I wondered
vaguely, as I clung to the sack of gold we
had risked so much to secure, how long it would
be before the wind swept us away, or we would
be annihilated by a bolt of lightning.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently an arm was laid across my back,
as if to protect me, and raising my head I saw
by the light of a vivid flash that Bryonia had
joined us and was lying in the hollow at my side.</p>

<p class='c009'>I wondered how the daring Sulu had ever
managed to reach us; but the strong arm gave
me a new sense of security, and impulsively I
seized the black man’s hand and pressed it to express
my gratitude and welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>An instant later a terrible crash sounded in
my ears, while at the same time a blast of fire
swept over the rock and seemed to bathe our
three prostrate figures in its withering flame.
Again came a crash; and another—and still another,
while the crisp lightning darted through
the air and made each nerve of our bodies tingle
as if pricked by myriads of needle points.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half bewildered, I raised my head, and saw
the great rocking-stone sway from side to side
and then plunge headlong into the gulf that lay
between the precipice and the solitary rock whereon
we reclined. And I felt the mighty column of
rock shake and lean outward, as if about to topple
into the sea, while the impact of the fallen
mass reverberated above the shriek of the wind
and the thunder’s loudest roar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Instinctively I braced myself for the end—the
seemingly inevitable outcome of this terrible catastrophe;
but to my surprise no violent calamity
overwhelmed us. Instead, the lightning, as if
satisfied with its work of destruction, gradually
abated. The blinding flashes no longer pained
my closed eyes with their vivid recurrence, and
even the wind and rain moderated and grew less
violent.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />BURIED ALIVE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Terrified beyond measure by the awfulness of
the storm, I gave little heed to the fact that the
rocky hollow in which I lay with the two faithful
blacks had filled with water, so that our bodies
were nearly covered by the pool that had formed.
My head still rested on the trousers packed with
gold, and one arm was closely clasped around a
leg containing the treasured metal grains. So I
lay, half dazed and scarcely daring to move,
while the rain pattered down upon us and the
storm sobbed itself out by degrees.</p>

<p class='c009'>I must have lost consciousness, after a time,
for my first distinct recollection is of Bryonia
drawing my body from the pool to lay it on a
dryer portion of the rock, where the overhanging
trees slightly sheltered me. The sky had
grown lighter by now, and while black streaks
of cloud still drifted swiftly across the face of the
moon, there were times when the great disc was
clear, and shed its light brilliantly over the bleak
and desolate landscape.</p>

<p class='c009'>Within an hour the rain had ceased altogether,
and stars came out to join the moon; but still we
lay motionless atop the peak of rock, worn out
by our struggles with the elements and fitfully
dozing in spite of the horrors we had passed
through.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry was first to arouse, and found the sun
shining overhead. There was no wind and the
temperature of the morning air was warm and
genial. The black’s legs pained him, for in his
terrible climb up the rock during the storm a
jagged piece of rock had cut his thigh and torn
the flesh badly. He had not noticed it until now,
but after examining the wound he bathed it in
the water of the pool and bound it up with a rag
torn from his shirt.</p>

<p class='c009'>While he was thus occupied Nux sat up and
watched him, yawning. They spoke together in
low tones, using the expressive Sulu language,
and had soon acquainted each other with the events
that had occurred since they separated. Their
murmured words aroused me to a realization of
the present, and having partially collected my
thoughts I began to rub my eyes and look wonderingly
around me.</p>

<p class='c009'>The top of the rock was no longer flat, but inclined
toward the sea. The three tall trees also
inclined that way, instead of growing upright,
and the neighboring cliff of the mainland seemed
further removed from us than before. Something
appeared to be missing in the landscape, and then
I suddenly remembered how the rocking-stone
had leaped into the gulf during the storm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All safe?” I asked, looking at my black
friends gratefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All safe,” answered Bry, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was a dreadful night,” I continued, with
a shudder. “Have you heard anything from the
robbers yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Mars Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They’re probably sleeping late. Anyhow,
they can’t have gone away on the raft yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All very wicked mans, Mars Sam,” he said.
“Even in big storm, while we climb up to cave,
Mars Daggett tell me to go behind Pete an’ push
him off rock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The villain!” I exclaimed, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He tell me if I not push Pete off, he kill me,”
continued Bry, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When they run into cave, I run by it, an’
come here. That’s all, Mars Sam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did well, Bry. If they climb up here after
you, we’ll fight them to the death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No climb rock any more, Mars Sam,” said
Bry, soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“See how rock tip? Only fly can climb rock
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you’re right, Bry!” I cried, startled
at this dreadful assertion; “and, if so, we’re prisoners
here. Let us see what it looks like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I crawled rather stiffly down the inclined surface
to the edge overlooking the sea, and one
glance showed me that it would now be impossible
for anyone to walk along the narrow ledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>While I looked a sharp cry of horror from
Nux reached my ears, and swiftly turning I
hastened with Bry toward the place where the
black was leaning over the gulf that separated
the peak from the mainland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it, Nux?” I asked, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Sulu only stood motionless, pointing
with one finger into the abyss, while his eyes
stared downward with an expression of abject
fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>We both followed his gaze, and one glance
was sufficient to fully acquaint us with the awful
catastrophe the vengeance of the storm had
wrought.</p>

<p class='c009'>The huge rocking-stone, weighing thousands
of tons, which for ages had remained delicately
balanced upon the edge of the chasm, had been
struck by a bolt of lightning and torn from its
base. Crashing into the gulf, a point of the great,
wedge-shaped boulder had entered the mouth of
the cave where the desperadoes sought shelter,
and, crowded forward by its own weight, it had
sealed up the robbers in a living grave, from
whence no power of man could ever rescue them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was this mighty wedge, crowded into the
space between the slender peak and the main cliff,
that had caused the former to lean outward; and
in one comprehensive look we were able to read
the whole story of the night’s tragedy—a tragedy
we had instinctively felt in the crash of the storm,
but could only realize now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor fellows!” I whispered, softly, forgetting
in my awe that they had been our relentless
enemies. “It was a terrible fate. Perhaps they’re
even now sitting in that dark hole, shut off from
all the world and waiting for death to overtake
them. Isn’t it dreadful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The blacks glanced at one another without reply;
but I noticed that they exchanged a secret
sign which their pagan priests had taught them
when they were boys, and which was supposed
to propitiate the demon of retribution. To their
simple minds Daggett and his gang of cut-throats
had been properly punished for their wickedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>But for my part I am glad to remember that
at the moment I ignored the fact that these men
were wicked, and grieved that four human beings
had suddenly been cut off in the prime of their
manhood. The recollection of their crimes might
temper my regret afterward, but just now my
thoughts were all of sorrow and commiseration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux roused me from my reflections by asking:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What we do now, Mars Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” I answered, despairingly. “If
we can’t escape from this rock we are little better
off than those poor fellows below us. See! the
stone, as it fell, tore away the ledge completely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No climb down, any way at all,” said Bry,
squatting upon the rock and clasping his knees
with his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We haven’t any rope, or enough clothing to
make one,” I continued, striving to be calm and
to force myself to think clearly. “But if we remain
up here it won’t take us long to die of thirst
or starvation. The aggravating thing about it is
that the mainland is just too far away for us to
leap across to it. We’re in a bad fix, boys, and
no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry gazed reflectively at the trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we had axe,” said he, “we chop down tree,
and make fall across the gulf.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! that’s a clever idea,” I cried; but my
elation quickly subsided, and I added gloomily,
in the next breath: “only we have no axe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry made no answer, but sat thoughtfully gazing
around him. Presently he began to creep
around the table of rock on his hands and knees,
examining every part of its surface with great
care.</p>

<p class='c009'>At one place, where the edge of the rock was
jagged and of a harder character than the rest,
he paused to make a more thorough examination,
and then he drew out his one-bladed jack-knife
and began prying into the rock with its point.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux and I immediately crept to his side to
see what he was doing, and soon Bry had loosened
a piece of rock that weighed about five pounds.
It was flat on the lower surface and of irregular
circular form. This fragment the Sulu examined
with great care, and struck it sharply against the
rock without breaking it. It seemed to meet his
approval, for he laid it carefully aside and at once
attempted to pry up another portion of the hard
rock. Then, when he had again succeeded, he sat
down and began cautiously chipping one piece
of rock against the other, until he had brought the
first fragment to a wedge shape that resembled a
rude axe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I understand now what you’re about,
Bry,” I exclaimed, delightedly. “Do you think
you can make it work?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That way we make axe in Jolo-Jolo,” he said,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>He now handed the rude implement to Nux,
who seemed to comprehend without words what
was required of him, for he at once began rubbing
the edge of the stone axe upon a rough portion
of rock to smooth and sharpen it more perfectly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Bry pried up more rock and
formed a second axe-head, and so for several
hours the men labored patiently at their task,
while I, unable to be of assistance, sat watching
them with breathless interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the second axe was ready for Nux to
sharpen, Bry climbed up the trunk of one of the
tall pines and, selecting a branch of the size he
desired, with much effort cut it from the tree with
his knife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he descended, trimmed the branch, and
began fashioning it into an axe-handle. He made
no attempt to render it graceful or beautiful, you
may be sure. The one requirement was service,
and the wood was tough and strong enough to
answer the purpose required.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time the handle was ready Nux had
worn the edge of the first rude stone axe to a
fair degree of sharpness, and with it Bry split
the end of the handle far enough down to wedge
the axe-head between the pieces. Then he bound
the top together with strips of bark cut from a
young limb, which was far stronger than any cord
would have been.</p>

<p class='c009'>A clumsy instrument it seemed to be, when it
was finished; but Bry balanced it gravely in his
hands, and swung it around his head, and nodded
his full approval and satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we chop down tree,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the three trees that fortunately grew upon
the column of rock, two were evidently too short
to reach across the gulf from where they stood.
But the third was close to the edge, and towered
well above its fellows; so this was the one Bry
selected. A woodsman would probably have
laughed at the strokes dealt by the Sulu; but Bry
knew what he was about, for he had chopped trees
in this way before. Too hard a blow would have
crushed the stone edge of the weapon, and a prying
motion would have broken it at once; so the
black struck straight and true, and not with too
much force, and slowly but surely wore through
the stalwart trunk of the tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the axe got dull he unbound the bark
thongs and exchanged it for the other, while Nux
re-sharpened it. This consumed a good deal of
time, and the day was far advanced before Bry
decided that the chopping was deep enough to
allow them to fell the tree. This they did in a
peculiar way, for Nux climbed into the high
branches and then, aided by Bry and me, who
pushed from below, he began swaying the tree
back and forth, his own weight adding to the
strain, until suddenly it gave way at the stump
and—slowly at first, but with ever accelerating
speed—fell with a crash across the gulf.</p>

<p class='c009'>It looked like a trying and dangerous position
for Nux; but the black cleverly kept on the outer
side of the branches, which broke his fall so perfectly
that even as the tree touched the cliff he
sprang to the ground safe and uninjured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hooray!” I shouted, in delight; for this
bridge removed from my heart all terrors of starvation
and imprisonment, affording us a means
of leaving the islet of rock as soon as we pleased
to go.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sun was even now sinking below the
horizon, so we decided not to effect the crossing
until morning. Nux climbed back over the swaying
trunk, and after he had rejoined us we ate the
last crumbs of food we possessed for our supper
and then lay down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Having passed the day in idleness I found I
was not very tired or sleepy; but the blacks were
thoroughly exhausted by their labors, and they
welcomed the rest as only weary men can.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long after they were snoring I sat in the
moonlight thinking of our strange adventures of
the past twenty-four hours; the recovery of the
gold, the destruction of the robbers, and our present
means of release from the dangerous pinnacle
that had threatened to hold us fast prisoners.
And I realized, with a grateful heart, that I
owed all of my good fortune and narrow escapes
to the faithful black men, and made a vow that
I would never in the future forget the services
they had rendered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c004'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />THE MAJOR GIVES CHASE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Meantime there had been much excitement
and confusion in the camp when it was discovered
that several of the men, including Nux and Bry,
and even “the boy Sam,” had disappeared during
the night with most of the gold dust that had been
accumulated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I can relate fairly well what occurred, for I
heard the story often enough afterward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major was furious with rage, at first, and
sent at once for Uncle Naboth, whom he accused
of being at the bottom of the plot to rob him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Perkins was so full of his own anxieties
that he paid little attention to the red-bearded
giant’s ravings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid Sam’s in trouble,” he said, nervously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In trouble! You bet he is,” yelled the
Major, “I’ll skin him alive when I catch him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the point,” answered Uncle Naboth.
“How are we to find him again? I’ll risk your
hurting the boy, if we can only find out where
they’ve taken him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your niggers are gone, too,” the Major reminded
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the only thing that gives me hope,
sir,” retorted my Uncle. “Those black men are
as faithful and honest as any men on earth, and
I’m thinking they’re gone after Sam to try to
rescue him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you think he’s been kidnapped, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course. The men that are missing are
the worst of your lot—the ones that have caused
you the most trouble in every way. There’s not
a man from the “Flipper’s” crew among them.
The way I figure it out is that Daggett, Larkin,
Hayes and Judson have made a plot to steal all the
gold, and escape with it. They robbed you first,
and then they robbed Sam, and when the boy tried
to make a fuss they just kidnapped him and took
him along with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How about the niggers?” asked the Major,
sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That puzzles me, I’ll admit,” acknowledged
my Uncle. “Bry and Nux may have seen the
thieves get away with Sam, and followed after
them, to try to rescue him. That’s the only way
I can figure it out just now. But we’re losing
time, Major. What’s to be done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two things. Get back the gold, and shoot
down the robbers like dogs. They can’t get away,
you know. They’re somewhere on this island,
and I mean to find them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What of it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If they get aboard and sail away we’ll be in
a bad box.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can they get aboard? We’ve got the
small boats.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They can make a raft, or even swim out to
the ship,” returned Uncle Naboth, shrewdly.
“I tell you, Major, you’re wasting time. Why
don’t you do something?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major glanced at him as if undecided
whether to be angry with him or not. But Mr.
Perkins was undoubtedly right, and the miners
were gathering outside the door with curses and
threats against the men who had robbed them, for
the news had quickly spread throughout the camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>So their leader sent six men, heavily armed,
in the ship’s longboat to board the “Flipper” and
protect the vessel from being captured. These
were all his own men, for he still suspected that
the “Flipper’s” crew were in some way implicated
in the theft.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he picked four miners and four of the
sailors to form a party to search for the robbers,
and decided to lead the band himself and to take
Uncle Naboth with him. The rest of the men
were ordered to resume their work of washing
out gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to trust you, Perkins,” said the
Major, “for your loss is as great as ours, and
you seem anxious over that boy of yours. But if
I meet with any treachery I’ll shoot you on the
spot; and if I find that Sam Steele is one of the
thieves I’ll show him no mercy, I promise you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite satisfactory, sir,” answered Uncle Naboth,
calmly. “Only let us get started as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a puzzle at first to know in which direction
to look for the fugitives; but Ned Britton
had been carefully inspecting the edge of the
forest, and came upon one of the paths Daggett
had made in the course of his various wanderings
inland. It was not the one we had taken, but
away they started through the thicket, on a false
scent, and the entire day was consumed in a vain
search.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they sat over their camp fire at evening
Ned proposed that they try the other side of the
island the following day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s there where the ship lies anchored, sir,”
he told the Major; “and it’s most likely the men
are in that neighborhood. The paths we’ve been
following today are old trails that lead nowhere
in particular, and there’s no use going any further
in this direction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This proposition was so sensible that the
Major at once agreed to it, and daybreak saw
them tramping through the tangled underbrush
toward the opposite side of the Island. Britton,
who had a good sense of direction and knew
about where the ship lay, undertook to guide
them, and was fortunate enough to strike the
trail of the robbers about the middle of the afternoon.
The tracks lay directly toward the beach,
and they pressed on with renewed vigor; but the
heat was terribly oppressive in the more open
country they had now reached, and the men were
all exhausted by the long tramp. When, a little
later, the sky grew black and the storm burst
upon them, they withdrew to a thick grove of
trees and rigged up a temporary shelter with their
blankets, beneath which they passed the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>The storm raged all around them, and occasionally
the crash of a fallen tree startled their
nerves; but the high cliff broke the force of the
wind and the lightning was less severe than it
was directly on the coast.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth thought of me more than once
during this rage of the elements, and hoped I
was safe from harm; indeed, his anxiety was so
great that he scarcely closed his eyes throughout
the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak they left their shelter and gazed
wonderingly at the scene of devastation around
them. The storm had wrought fearful havoc
everywhere, and when they resumed their journey
their progress was necessarily slow and difficult.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still they labored on, and in the afternoon
passed through the forest and came upon the
coast directly opposite the place where the “Flipper”
still rode at anchor under bare masts. She
seemed to have escaped all danger from the storm,
and although the sea was still rolling high the
good ship nodded her prow to each wave with a
grace that betokened she was still in good condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, boys, the robbers haven’t got her yet!”
cried Uncle Naboth, delightedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; but they’ve had a try for it already,”
said the Major, significantly, as he pointed to a
half-finished raft that had been lifted high by
the waves of the previous night and wedged
fast between two great trees. “Evidently the
scoundrels don’t know we have sent a squad to
guard the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re on their trail, all right,” remarked
Ned Britton, after examining the crudely constructed
raft carefully. “But where do you suppose
they are?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Somewhere on the coast, of course,” said
Uncle Naboth. “Let’s walk up the edge of the
bay to the inlet, and see if they’re in that direction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they made for the inlet, failing, of course,
to find any traces of the thieves. They were seen
from the deck of the “Flipper” by the men who
had been sent aboard in the long boat, and the
Major signaled them to remain where they were
for the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a brief halt the little band retraced their
steps to examine the coast in the other direction,
and another night overtook them within hailing
distance of the rocky peak where I and my two
blacks were resting beside our newly acquired
bridge to await impatiently the morning. But
the Major’s party was, of course, unaware of
this, and went into camp in a hollow where the
light of their fire was unobserved by us.</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak, however, Uncle Naboth and Ned
Britton were up and anxiously exploring the
coast; and presently they saw, a little distance
away, the tall form of Bryonia walking carefully
across our tree trunk. The black almost fell into
the arms of Uncle Naboth, as he stepped off the
tree and the old man’s first anxious question was:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s Sam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here I am, Uncle!” I called from my rock.
“I’ll be with you in a minute, but we’ve got to
get the gold over first.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gold!” cried Uncle Naboth, in amazement.
“Have you got it, then, after all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure,” said I, with a touch of pride,
“every grain of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth groaned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t think as you’d do it, Sam, my boy,”
he said regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t have done it, without Nux and
Bry,” I answered, not understanding that I had
been accused of the theft.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man turned reproachfully to Bry,
who stood grinning beside him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I ever teach you to steal, sir?” he demanded,
sternly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Takin’ gold from robbers ain’t stealin’,” replied
the black, in a calm tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What robbers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Daggett, an’ Pete, an’——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I see!” exclaimed Uncle Naboth, a light
breaking in upon his confused mind. “They
stole the gold from the camp, I suppose, and you
and Sam have followed them up, and got it back
again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s it, exactly, Uncle!” I declared from
my side of the precipice, where I could hear every
word spoken. “I’ll tell you the whole story bye
and bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then I was wondering if I dared cross
the tree. It seemed very frail, and the rounded
trunk was difficult to walk upon. Should I lose
my balance there were only a few slender branches
to cling to in order to keep from toppling over
into the gulf below.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bry saw my dilemma, however, and running
lightly across the tree again he caught me up
bodily and perched me upon his broad shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold fast, Mars Sam,” he called, and the
next moment stepped out fearlessly and, while
Uncle Naboth held his breath in grim suspense,
the black crossed the swaying tree and dropped
me safely on the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man had barely time to grasp both
my hands in a warm clasp when the big Major
came up, blowing and sputtering, with the balance
of the party.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, where’s the rest o’ the thieves?” he
cried out, glaring fiercely at me and then at Bry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under that rock, sir,” I answered gravely,
with a shudder at the recollection of their dreadful
punishment; and then, in as few words as possible,
I told the story of our adventures, relating
how we had followed the robbers and recovered
the gold, and of the great storm that had sent the
rocking-stone hurling into the chasm to seal up
the evil band in a living tomb.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the Major was impressed by the weird
tale, and Uncle Naboth wiped the sweat from his
brow as he leaned over the cliff and marked the
immense wedge of rock that had closed forever
the mouth of the cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems there’s no one left to punish,”
growled the red-beard, in a low voice; “and I’m
glad the fate of those scoundrels was taken out of
my hands. As for you, young man,” turning suddenly
to me, “you’ve acted splendidly, an’ so have
the niggers. Let’s shake hands all ’round!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt my face turn as red as the Major’s
whiskers at this unexpected praise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hooray!” yelled Ned Britton, and the others
joined him in a mighty shout of approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ned and Bry crossed the tree to where
Nux was still standing on the peak, and hoisted
the loaded trousers to Bryonia’s back. Nux
crossed over in front and Ned Britton behind the
bearer of the precious gold, to save him if he made
a misstep; but their caution was unnecessary.
The big Sulu was as sure-footed as a goat, and
safely deposited his burden at the Major’s feet.
Then we all returned to the near-by camp for
breakfast, after which, the gold being taken from
the trousers and distributed into several small
packages, that they might be more easily carried,
Nux was given his leg-coverings again, to his
infinite satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now,” said the Major, “we’ll make
tracks for the camp. We’ve been away a long
time, but we’ve got the gold back, and got rid of
the worst characters among the lot of us; so
there’s nothing much to grumble over, after all.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />THE GRAVE CAPTAIN GAY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Perhaps it was only natural that I should become
the hero of the miners when the camp was at
last reached and the men learned the strange story
of our recovery of the gold. Nux and Bry also
came in for a good share of praise, which they
well deserved, and it seemed as if the adventure
had established a permanent good feeling between
the gold seekers and our crew of the “Flipper.”
There was no more suspicion on either side, and
when the Major made a new division of the recovered
gold he generously insisted that I should
receive even more than I had been robbed of, for
my share. Whatever the Major’s faults might
be, he was certainly liberal in his dealings with
others, and Uncle Naboth was greatly pleased
with the profitable result of an adventure that had
at first threatened to ruin the fortunes of the firm
of Perkins &amp; Steele.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one mourned very much over the death of
the men who had stolen the gold; on the contrary,
there was a feeling of general relief that the four
desperadoes were unable to cause any more
trouble. Therefore the camp resumed its former
routine, and the miners set to work with renewed
vigor to wash out the golden grains from the rich
sands of the inlet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was about this time that the grave and reserved
Captain Gay proved himself to be a genius,
and by an act of real cleverness that crowned his
name with glory materially shortened the stay
of our entire community on the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain had worked side by side with
the common sailors, for the Major showed no
favoritism, and insisted that every able-bodied
man should perform his share of the work. Even
Uncle Naboth had from the first day of our capture
toiled from morning till night; but he accepted
his tasks with rare good nature, and frequently
confided to me, in his droll way, that his
enforced labor had added ten years to his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was gettin’ altogether too chunked and
fat,” he said one evening, “and likely enough I’d
’a’ been troubled sooner or later with apoplexy or
dropsical. But now I’ve lost twenty or thirty
pounds weight, an’ feel as lively as a cricket in
a hornet’s nest. Work’s a good thing, Sam. I’m
glad the Major made me do it. Probably he’s
saved my life by his cussedness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay had been working at the upper
end of the inlet, near to the place where a slender
mountain stream fell from a precipice above and
mingled its fresh water with that of the inlet.
This stream fell upon a rocky bottom, but in
course of years it had worn a bowl-shaped hollow
in the rock, which could be distinctly observed
through the transparent water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There ought to be a lot of gold in that hollow,”
Ned Britton had remarked to the Captain
one day. “I’ve an idea all the gold we find in the
sands of the inlet has been brought here by the
mountain streams.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve been thinking that, myself,” answered
the Captain; but it was a week later that he
climbed the rock and followed the bent of the
stream for nearly a mile, marking carefully the
lay of the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning he went to the Major with
his plan, which was nothing less than a proposal
to turn the stream from its bed, several hundred
yards above, and let it follow a new course and
reach the inlet a hundred feet distant from its
present fall.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major stared thoughtfully at the Captain
for a time, and then followed him up the stream
and made a careful examination of the territory.
The result was an order for all the seamen of the
“Flipper” to place themselves at the disposal of
Captain Gay and obey his orders.</p>

<p class='c009'>In three days they had built a dam of rocks
and brushwood nearly across the stream, and
pried away the banks in another place to allow
the water to escape by the new channel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth day the opening was closed in the
dam, and the stream plunged away on its new
course, leaving its former bed practically dry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately the men ran down to the inlet,
where the Major himself waded to the hollow
caused by the previous fall of water and dipped
up a pan of sand from the cavity. Upon examination
it proved richer in gold than any of us had
anticipated, the sands containing many small nuggets
which, being heavier than the grains of
metal, had been accumulating for many years in
the basin.</p>

<p class='c009'>All hands were set to work in this locality,
and inspired by the rich harvest that rewarded
their toil, they labored early and late, until the
bags of dust and nuggets had become so numerous
that even the Major was filled with amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this was not all that was gained by turning
the mountain stream from its bed. In several
hollows up above Captain Gay discovered rich
deposits of small nuggets that were secured with
ease, and two weeks later the Major called a
meeting of all the members of the party on the
sands before his tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Boys,” said he, “we’ve got enough to make
every one of us rich for life. What’s the use of
staying here longer? I’m getting homesick, for
one, and a good many of you are longing to get
back to the States and begin spending your piles.
What do you say—shall we board the ship and go
home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes!” they yelled, without a dissenting voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then,” said the Major, “tomorrow we’ll
divide the spoils, so that every man has his honest
share; and then we’ll pay our passage money to
Mr. Perkins and sail away home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The division was accomplished with very little
dissatisfaction or friction, for the worst elements
in our assorted company had been removed, and
the Major was absolutely just in his decisions.
One or two, to be sure, grumbled that the provisions
from the “Flipper” had been purchased at
too high a price, or that too much of the gold was
set aside to pay for the passage back to San Francisco;
but not one objected when the Major set
aside three heavy bags of gold to reward Captain
Gay for his clever feat in turning the mountain
stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Uncle Naboth and I, in the seclusion of
my hut, had figured out our share of the profits,
the old man was hugely delighted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My partner!” he exclaimed, slapping his
thigh with enthusiasm, “it’s paid us better than
three trips to Alaska! We’ve nearly made our
fortunes, Sam, my boy, and if we get safe home
again we can thank the Major for making us his
prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It did not take our party long to transfer all
their possessions to the decks of the “Flipper,”
where the ship’s carpenter and part of the crew
had been sent beforehand to clear up the rigging,
ship a new rudder, and make some repairs that
had been rendered necessary by the storm that
had driven us to this strange island.</p>

<p class='c009'>To my own inexperienced eyes the damage
had been so great that it seemed as if the sailors
would require weeks in which to make the vessel fit
to put to sea again; so that I was astonished,
when I went aboard, to note how quickly the task
had been accomplished. Indeed, the “Flipper”
seemed as trim and staunch as when she last
sailed out of the Golden Gate, and doubtless she
was fully able to bear us all safely home again.</p>

<p class='c009'>All our party having been put aboard, together
with their property, Captain Gay ordered
the anchors hoisted, and at eleven o’clock on the
morning of September 16th, the “Flipper”
headed out to sea before a fair breeze.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quarters aft had been given up to the
miners, most of whom were obliged to swing
hammocks in the cabin. The mate offered his
little room to the Major and bunked with the sailors
in the forecastle; but Captain Gay and Mr.
Perkins retained their own rooms, and so did I,
in order to watch over the firm’s gold, which was
stowed carefully away in my lockers. You may
be sure I was glad to get back to my books and
my comfortable bed again, and overjoyed to find
myself on the way to a more civilized land.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the ship stood out to sea, the Major, who
had been pacing the deck with a thoughtful brow,
noticed Captain Gay taking his bearings with the
aid of the sextant, while I stood by observing
him. At once the big man’s countenance cleared,
and he strode over to us and anxiously watched
the Captain while the latter made notes of his observations.
Several of the miners likewise seemed
interested, but it was evident they did not understand
in the least what the Captain was doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner, however, had Captain Gay returned
to his cabin, where at his request I followed
him, than the Major knocked for admittance,
and being invited to enter he cautiously
closed the door after him and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve relieved me of a great worry, Captain.
I was afraid we’d never be able to find this
island again. But the sextant gives you the latitude
and longitude, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay nodded, and looked thoughtfully
out of his little window at the fast receding island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That island’s mine,” continued the Major,
in a stem voice; “and I shall claim it until some
one else proves a better right to the place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still the Captain made no reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major stared at him as though he had
just discovered the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does any one else aboard know how to use
those instruments?” he finally asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one,” answered the Captain, briefly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the secret is safe with us,” resumed the
Major. “I’ll just trouble you, my good fellow,
to give me the exact latitude and longitude of the
island. I’ll mark them down in my note-book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come to me tomorrow noon,” said Captain
Gay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why tomorrow noon?” with a sudden frown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t you understand? Don’t you know it
requires hours to figure out so complicated a
problem?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, does it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A nod.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll come in tomorrow. But understand,
not a word of the true reckoning to a soul
on board. Not even to Perkins or the boy here,
who has no business to be listening to this conversation,
and had better forget it. The island
is mine!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay sat silent, merely drumming with
his fingers on the little table before him. The
Major gave him another curious look and stalked
away, whistling softly to himself, as if something
had occurred to puzzle him. Indeed, the Captain’s
face was so set and stern that it made me
uncomfortable, and I soon left him and returned
to my own room.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “Flipper” made good time during the
afternoon, and before darkness fell those on
board saw the island where they had labored so
hard and endured so much, gradually sink into
the sea and disappear.</p>

<p class='c009'>The breeze held all through the night, and
daybreak found the sturdy ship plowing steadily
onward over the waste of gray waters. The sailors
had fallen into their usual routine and performed
their labors with mechanical precision,
while the miners lay around the deck and watched
them with the interest landsmen usually show
when on a sailing ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the stroke of twelve I saw the Major
promptly approach the Captain’s room, where I
knew the seaman was busily engaged in writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Wishing to learn the result of this second interview
I crept forward and without hesitation
established myself beside the door, which the red-beard
had carelessly left ajar. I even ventured to
peer curiously through the opening; but neither
of the men observed my intrusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major for a moment stood staring with
the same wondering gaze he had bestowed on
Captain Gay the day before; but suddenly his
face brightened and he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jupiter! I’ve struck it at last!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Struck what?” asked the Captain, looking
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The resemblance that bothered me. You’re
the living image of that man Daggett, who caused
us that trouble on the island. It’s a wonder I
never noticed it before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain flushed, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No relation, I hope?” queried the Major,
grinning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To Daggett?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; the scoundrel who stole our gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay had resumed his writing, but
said, lightly, as if the matter was too preposterous
to be treated seriously:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it likely, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But already the Major’s mind had turned to a
more important subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve come for that little memorandum, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What memorandum?” asked the Captain,
quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The location of the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh; I can’t give it to you,” said the other.
“When you left this room yesterday the draft
from the open door caught the paper I had made
my figures on, and carried it out of the window.
So the record is lost.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lost!” The Major stared at him in amazement</p>

<p class='c009'>“Absolutely lost, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean to tell me you don’t know
where that island is?” demanded the Major,
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t the slightest idea of its location.
During the night the helmsman altered our course
several times, steering by the stars. I think we’re
going in the right direction, but I can tell better
when I’ve taken our observations for today. Unfortunately,
however, that won’t help us to locate
the island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major sat down heavily on a chest. The
information he had received fairly dazed him, but
his gaze remained firmly fixed on the Captain’s
expressionless face.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a time he gave a laugh, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you yesterday that island was mine.
I’ll take that back. It’s <i>yours</i> and mine. You’ll
share it with me, Captain Gay, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is still yours, Major, as far as I’m concerned.
If I knew its location, I would tell you
willingly. But I don’t. You’ll have to find your
property yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major sprang up with an oath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You infernal scoundrel!” he cried, “do you
think I’ll be played with like this? Give me the
location of that island, or by the nine great gods,
I’ll kill you where you sit!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leave this room, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain was angry too, by this time. He
stood erect and pointed with dignity to the door-way,
from which I dodged with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I command this ship, sir,” he said, “and here
my will is law. I’ll endure no browbeating,
Major, or any insolence from you or any of my
passengers. On the island I obeyed you. Here
you will obey me, or I’ll lock you fast in your
cabin. Leave this room!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major stood irresolute a moment. Then
sullenly and slowly, he quit the cabin and returned
to the deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even to my wondering but immature intellect
it was evident that Captain Gay had won the
battle.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />WE GIVE UP THE SHIP.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>The “Flipper” made good time, and sighted
the Oregon coast on the morning of the fifth day.
From there she followed the dim outlines of the
distant land down to the Golden Gate, and cast
anchor safely and without event in the bay of San
Francisco.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Major had been sullen and ill-tempered
during the entire voyage, but although he made
repeated efforts to see Captain Gay privately and
renew his request for the location of the golden
island, that officer positively refused to hold any
further communication with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Therefore the Major was helpless. After all,
the Captain might be speaking the entire truth;
and if so all argument was useless. Threats do
not affect a man of his temperament, and beyond
threats the Major did not care to go, even to secure
the information he wished. Bribery, in such
a case, was absurd. Therefore nothing could be
done but bear the disappointment with a good
grace. The Major’s fortune was, for the present,
ample, and I wondered why he should ever
care to visit the island again.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the anchors were dropped the miners
clamored to be set ashore, and by night they
had all quitted the ship and established themselves
in lodgings in the town, from whence they
at once flocked to the bankers and began to turn
their golden grains into cash.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth and I remained on board another
day. There were settlements to be made
with the sailors and various other details that
needed attention at the close of the voyage; so
that I was kept busy with my books of accounts
and Uncle Naboth stood constantly at my elbow
to give me the necessary instructions.</p>

<p class='c009'>We both longed to be on shore again, however;
so as soon as the last formalities were completed,
we put our heavy sacks of gold into a boat
and carried them to the docks, from whence an
escort of our trusty sailors accompanied us to the
bank wherein Mr. Perkins was accustomed to
keep his deposits.</p>

<p class='c009'>So many ships had lately returned from
Alaska bearing gold from the mines that Mr.
Perkins’ heavy deposit aroused no wonder except
as to its extent, and the banker warmly congratulated
him upon his good fortune in making so
successful a voyage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Uncle Naboth and I remained at the
bank until every sack of gold had been carefully
weighed and sealed, and the proper receipt given.
Then, breathing freely for the first time since the
gold had been in our possession, we repaired to
my Uncle’s former lodging house, where Mr.
Perkins was warmly welcomed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll have the best dinner tonight the establishment
can set up, Sam, my boy,” said the old
man, rubbing his hands gleefully together; “for
we’ve got to celebrate the success of the new partnership.
You must ’a brought the firm luck, my
lad, for this here is the biggest haul I’ve heard of
since I’ve been in the business. We’re rich,
nevvy—rich as punkins!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much do you suppose we’re worth,
Uncle?” I enquired, rather curiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t tell exactly, o’ course, till after we’ve
got the quality of our gold properly graded, and
put it on the market; but my opinion is, we’re at
least fifty thousand dollars to the good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As much as that!” I exclaimed, greatly
elated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Full as much, I judge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then,” said I, drawing a sigh of relief, “I
can pay Mrs. Ranck that four hundred dollars I
owe her for my board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth made a wry face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a shame to throw good money away on
that old termagan’,” he remarked, “and I’ve no
doubt she’s been overpaid already, by stealin’ the
contents o’ Cap’n Steele’s chest. But if it’d make
you feel easier in your mind, Sam, I’ll fix it so
you can send her the money as soon as you like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Uncle,” I replied, gratefully,
“I’ll never be happy until the debt is off my
shoulders. Whether she’s entitled to the money
or not, I promised Mrs. Ranck I’d pay the debt,
and I want to keep my word.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An’ so you shall,” said Uncle Naboth, with
an approving nod.</p>

<p class='c009'>We feasted royally at dinner, and afterward
Uncle Naboth took me to the theatre, where we
sat in the top gallery among the crowd of laborers
and sailors, but enjoyed the play very much
indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some folks who had just banked fifty thousand,”
remarked my Uncle, reflectively, “would
want to sit down there among them nabobs, in a
seat that costs a dollar apiece—or perhaps two
dollars, for all I know. But what’s the use, Sam?
Do they hear or see any better than we do up
here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Probably not,” I answered, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we’re getting as much fun for our
quarter as they get for a dollar,” declared Uncle
Naboth, chuckling, “an’ tomorrow mornin’ we’ll
be so much richer, an’ nothin’ lost by it. Sam,
the secret o’ spendin’ money ain’t in puttin’ on
airs; it’s in gettin’ all the pleasure out of a nickel
that the nickel will buy. ‘Live high,’ is my
motto; but do it economical. That’s the true
philosophy o’ life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Next morning, as we were sitting in Uncle
Naboth’s little room, we were surprised by the
entrance of Captain Gay. He was accompanied
by two of the sailors from the “Flipper,” bearing
in their arms the easily recognized canvas sacks
of gold from the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain motioned his men to place the
sacks upon the rickety table, (which nearly
collapsed beneath the weight), and then ordered
them to leave the room. When they were gone
he carefully closed the door and turning to my
Uncle said, abruptly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, sir, is every grain of gold I got in that
accursed island. The most of it was given me for
turning the bed of the mountain stream, as you
will remember.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more than you deserved, sir,” said Uncle
Naboth, puffing his pipe vigorously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It ought to be worth a good deal of money,”
continued the Captain, his voice faltering slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twenty thousand at least, in my judgment,”
said Uncle Naboth, eyeing the sacks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir,” announced Captain Gay, with decision,
“I want to exchange this gold for a bill
of sale of the ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! The ‘Flipper?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth winked at me gravely, as if to
convey the suggestion that the man had gone
crazy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cap’n,” said he, after a pause, “I don’t mean
to say as Sam and I won’t sell the ship, if
you’d like to buy her; but the tub is old, and has
seen her best days. She’s worth about six thousand
dollars, all told, and not a penny more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must take all that gold or nothing, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean?” asked my Uncle, in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay sat down and looked thoughtfully
out of the window.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I must take you into my confidence,”
he remarked, in his slow, quiet tones, “although
at first I had thought this action would be unnecessary.
I’ve an idea I’d like to own a ship myself,
and to trade in a small way between here and
Portland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the golden island, occasionally; eh,
Cap’n?” returned Uncle Naboth, shrewdly. “I’ve
heard from Sam here how you lost the paper containing
your observations; but, I suppose you
could find the place again, if you wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Gay flushed a deep red.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir,” he answered, “you wrong me with your
suspicions. I shall never revisit that island under
any circumstances. Nor do I wish anyone
else to do so. That is the true explanation of
why I lost that paper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you lose it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I threw it overboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth whistled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m free to confess, sir, that I’m all at sea,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Captain arose and paced the room with
unusual agitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Perkins,” said he, “I once had an older
brother, who, when a boy, robbed my father and
ran away from home. I never saw him again until
we reached that island, where I recognized my
erring brother in the man who called himself
Daggett.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth scratched a match, and relit
his pipe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I marked the resemblance between you,”
he observed, “but I thought nothing of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To my grief I saw that he had not altered his
course for the better,” resumed the Captain. “Of
his final theft of the gold and the awful judgment
that overtook him and his fellows you are
well aware. I shall never forget the horror of
those days, sir. It seems to me that that isolated
unknown island is my brother’s tomb, where he
must lie until the call of the last judgment. I
do not wish anyone ever to visit the spot again,
if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s nonsense,” declared Uncle Naboth,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps so; but it’s the way I feel. That’s
why I don’t wish to touch the gold. I’ll take the
ship in exchange for it, but I won’t use the stuff
in any other way, or have anything more to do
with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re foolish,” said Uncle Naboth, with a
sternness quite foreign to his nature. “But if
you really want to give away a matter of twenty
thousand for an old hulk that’s worth about six,
I’ll let you have your way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my desire, sir,” announced our visitor,
meekly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, we’ll go to a lawyer and draw up
the papers. Sam, you stay here and look after
the gold, till I get back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, sir,” I replied, full of wonder at
this queer business transaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Together they left the room, and it was an
hour before Mr. Perkins returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I signed for both of us, partner,” he said,
briskly, “an’ the ‘Flipper’s’ now the sole property
of Cap’n Gay. With the money this gold will
bring, we can buy a ship twice as good as the
old one, in which, with good luck to back us, we
ought to make many a prosperous voyage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why do you think he did it, sir,” I enquired
musingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just one of two things,” replied Mr.
Perkins. “Either the man’s a bit cracked, as I’ve
sometimes suspected, and really feels sentimental
about his brother’s death, or else he’s got a sly
scheme to make trips to the island in an old ship
that won’t attract attention, and bring away many
cargoes of gold. That ain’t so unlikely, Sam.
No one will remark on Cap’n Gay’s owning the
old ship he’s commanded for years; but if he
bought a new one, and started out for the island,
he might be watched and his true business suspected.
Either the feller’s mighty deep, or mighty
innocent; but it ain’t our business to decide
which. We’ve got the money, and now we’ll look
for a newer and finer ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“New England’s the best place to buy a good
ship, sir. I’ve often heard my father say so,” I
suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then let’s go to New England,” returned
Uncle Naboth, promptly. “We’ll travel together,
and you can run up to Batteraft and pay the old
hag that money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to do that,” said I, greatly pleased.
“It would do me good to see her surprise when
she finds I’ve earned so much money already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then it’s all settled,” declared Uncle Naboth.
“I’ll go up to the village with you, and see
fair play. ’Twould be a fine chance to give that
cankered Venus a piece of my mind, just as a
parting shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you dare, sir,” I asked, recollecting
his former experience with Mrs. Ranck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would I dare? Do you take me for a coward,
then?” demanded the old man, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir, but I remember——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind that, Sam. I was worried about
other things that day, and wasn’t quite myself.
But <i>now</i>—well, just wait till I get the old serpent
face to face. That’s all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Uncle. When shall we go?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as soon as we’ve paid all the bills and
settled our accounts for the last voyage. A
week’ll do that, I reckon. An’ now, partner, just
run out and hire a closed carriage, and we’ll get
Cap’n Gay’s gold to the bank as soon as possible.
Sam, my boy, if this streak o’ luck holds good
we’ll be the envy of Rockyfeller in a few years!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />UNCLE NABOTH’S REVENGE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Ten days later, having paid all our indebtedness
and converted every ounce of our gold into
ready money that was deposited to the credit of
“Perkins &amp; Steele,” at the bank, we started on
what Uncle Naboth called our “voyage” across
the continent.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had both taken a strong liking for Ned
Britton, who had stood by us so faithfully at the
island; so Mr. Perkins decided to make Ned the
mate of the new ship, when she had been purchased.
For this reason, and because the sailor
wished to revisit some of his relatives in the East
and make them happy by sharing with them his
prize money, Ned also traveled on the same train
with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Britton’s judgment will be useful in helping
us to pick out a ship,” said the old man. “I’m
glad he’s going with us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nux and Bryonia had promptly deserted the
“Flipper” as soon as they found that Captain Gay
had purchased her, and I think my hardest task
was to leave the simple black men behind me.
They declared that they belonged to “the firm”
and must be given places on the new ship, and this
both Uncle Naboth and I were anxious to do, as
we knew we could never again find such loyal
and unselfish servants. But it would be folly to
take them east until all arrangements had been
made. So I found them comfortable lodgings,
and supplied them with all the money they could
possibly require until they were sent for. At the
last moment they were at the station to see the
train move away, and were so fearful of the iron
monster that was to carry their friends on the
journey that they cautioned me again and again
to be very careful in my actions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Fore all, Mars Sam,” said Nux, earnestly,
“doan’ you go skeer dat injine on no ’count.
W’en it’s skeert it smashes ev’ything into mush.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Pears gentle ’nouf now, Sam,” added Bry;
“but don’ you trust it, no how. ’Tain’t safe, like
a great sail an’ a stiff breeze.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right you are, lad,” cried Uncle Naboth,
approvingly. “Injines is an invention of the devil,
Bry, but good Christians can use ’em if they only
watch out. An’ now, good-bye, an’ take care o’
yourselves till we get back or send for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On account of our great wealth, Mr. Perkins
had decided to take a tourist sleeping-car for the
trip, rather than sit up in the seats of the common
cars all night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sleepin’ cars is a genuine luxury, Sam,” he
said, “an’ only fit for the very rich, who’ve got
so much money they won’t miss it, or the very
poor, who’ve got so little there’s no use savin’ it.
I guess we can afford the treat, and the bunks in
this ’ere tourist car is jest as big as the ones in the
high-priced coaches ahead. So as soon as we get
clear of ’Frisco, let’s go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it isn’t dark yet, Uncle,” I protested.
“It won’t be bedtime for hours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sam,” replied the old man, earnestly, “do
you mean to say you’re goin’ to pay for a bed and
let it lay idle? That’s what I call rank extravagance!
I’ve seen it done, on my travels, o’
course. I’ve known a man to pay three dollars for
a bed, an’ then set up half the night in the smokin’
cars before he turns in. But do you ’spose the
railroad company pays him back half the money?
Never. They just laughs at him and keeps the
whole three dollars! To pay for a thing, and use
it, ain’t extravagance; but to buy a bed, and then
set up half the night is. Why, it’s like payin’ for
a table-day-haughty dinner an’ then skippin’ half
the courses! Would a sensible man do that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not if he’s hungry, Uncle,” said I, laughing
at this philosophy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he ain’t hungry, he buys a sandwich, an’
not a table-day-haughty,” cried Uncle Naboth,
triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, being fully conscious of my
newly acquired wealth, I recklessly sat up until
bedtime, while my thrifty Uncle occupied his
“bunk” and snored peacefully. The journey was
accomplished in safety, and from Boston we took
the little railway to the seaport town of Batteraft.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the last hours of the trip Uncle Naboth
had become very thoughtful, and I frequently
noticed him making laborious memoranda
with his pencil on the backs of envelopes and
scraps of paper which he took from his wallet.
Finally I asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you writing, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m jest jotting down the things I mean to
say to that old female shark at Batteraft,” was
the reply. “I tell you, Sam, she’s goin’ to have
the talkin’-to of her life, when I get at her; and
she’ll deserve every word of it. I’ll let you pay
her first, so’s the money account will be square;
an’ then I’ll try to square the moral account.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will she let you?” I enquired doubtfully, for
I had a vivid remembrance of Mrs. Ranck’s dislike
of any opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She can’t help herself,” replied Uncle Naboth,
seriously. “If you knew the things she up
an’ said to me that day I tackled her before, Sam,
an’ the harsh an’ impident tones she used to say
’em with, you’d realize how much my revenge
means to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you resent it then, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, she took me by surprise, an’ I didn’t
have time to collect my parrergraphs, and that’s
the reason. Also it’s the reason I’m figgerin’ out
my speeches aforehand this time, so’s I won’t be
backwards when the time comes. You can’t
thrash the cantankerous old termagen’ like you
would a man, but you can lash her with speeches
that cuts like a two-edged sword. At sarcasm
and ironical I’m quite a professor, Sam; but them
talents would be wasted on Mrs. Ranck. With
her I’ll open my vials o’ wrath an’ empty ’em to
the dregs. I’ll wither her with scorn, an’—an’—an’
tell her just what I think o’ her,” he concluded,
rather lamely.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sighed, for the mention of Mrs. Ranck always
recalled to me the fate of my poor father.
The landscape began to grow very familiar now,
and presently the train swung into the little station
where I had so often stood in my younger
days to watch the passengers get on and off the
cars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ned Britton at once walked on to the tavern,
but as the afternoon was only half gone Uncle
Naboth and I decided to go on up to my father’s
old home without delay and have our carefully
planned interview with Mrs. Ranck. The bank-notes
I was to pay to her lay crisply in my new
pocket-book, and I was eager to be free of my
debt to the cruel woman who had aspersed my
dead father’s character and driven me from my
old home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth walked very fast at first, but
while we ascended the little hill his pace grew
gradually slower, and as we reached the well-remembered
bench beneath the trees, from whence
our first view of the cottage was obtained, my
uncle suddenly set himself down and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead with the well-remembered
crimson handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll rest a minute, Sam, so’s I can get my
breath back,” he gasped. “I’ll need it all, presently,
and hill-climbin’ ain’t my ’special accomplishment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So I sat down beside him and waited patiently,
eyeing the while rather sadly the old home where
I had once been so happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed not to have changed in any way since
I left it. The blinds of my little room in the attic
were closed, but those of the lower floor were
thrown back, and a column of thin smoke ascended
lazily from the chimney, showing that the
place was still inhabited.</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of myself I shivered. The autumn
air struck me as being chilly for the first time,
and the declining sun moved slowly behind a
cloud, throwing the same gloom over the landscape
that was already in my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you ready, Uncle?” I asked, unable to
bear the suspense longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jest a minute, Sam. Let’s see; the opening
shot was this way: There’s folks, ma’am, that
can be more heartless than the brute beasts, more
slyer than a roarin’ tiger, more fiercer than a yellow
fox, an’—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t right, Uncle Naboth,” I interrupted.
“The fox is sly and the tiger—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know, I know. Them speeches is gettin’
sorter mixed in my mind; but if that she-devil
don’t quail when she hears ’em, my name ain’t
Naboth Perkins! Perhaps I ought to have committed
’em more to memory—eh, Sam? What
do you say to waitin’ till tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Uncle. Let’s go to her now. You can
reserve your vials of wrath, if you want to; but
I shan’t sleep a wink unless I pay Mrs. Ranck
that money.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” said the old man, with assumed
cheerfulness. “There’s no time like the present.
‘Never put off ’til tomorrer,’ you know.
Come along, my lad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He sprang up and led the way with alacrity
for a few steps, and then slackened his pace perceptibly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I’m goin’ to forget all them speeches,” he
whispered, in a voice that trembled slightly, “I
might jest as well have saved my time a-composin’
of ’em. Drat the old she-pirate! If she wasn’t a
woman, I’d pitch her into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time I was myself too much agitated
to pay attention to my uncle’s evident fright on
the eve of battle. The house was very near now;
a few steps further and we were standing upon
the little porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You knock, Uncle,” I said, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth glanced at me reproachfully,
and then raised his knuckles. But before they
touched the panel of the door he paused, drew out
his handkerchief, and again wiped his brow.</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt that my nerves would bear no further
strain. With the desperation of despair or a sudden
accession of courage—I never knew which—I
rapped loudly upon the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment’s profound silence was followed by
a peculiar sound. Thump, thump, thump! echoed
from the room inside, at regular intervals, and
then the door was suddenly opened and a man
with a wooden leg stood before us. He was
clothed in sailor fashion and a bushy beard ornamented
his round, frank face.</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant we three stood regarding one
another in mute wonder. The open door disclosed
the long living-room, at the back end of
which Mrs. Ranck stood by the kitchen table with
a plate in one hand and a towel in the other, motionless
as a marble statue and with a look of
terror fixed upon her white face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Singularly enough, I was the first to recover
from my surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dad!” I cried, in a glad voice, and threw
myself joyfully into the sailor man’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why—Cap’n Steele, sir—what does this
mean?” faltered Uncle Naboth. “I thought you
was dead an’ gone, long ago, an’ safe in Davy
Jones’s locker!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE CONQUEST OF MRS. RANCK.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>I regret to say that my father’s welcome was
not especially cordial. Nevertheless, he was for
some reason evidently pleased by the sudden appearance
of his son and his brother-in-law. Releasing
himself gently from my clinging embrace,
he said, in his deep, grave voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in and sit down. I never thought to
see you again, Sam; and, much less you, Naboth
Perkins. But now that you’re here, we’ll have a
few mutual explanations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ranck, a few paces behind him, was
bristling like a frightened cat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If them thieves an’ scoundrels enters this
house, I’ll go out!” she fairly screamed, in her
shrill voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be quiet!” commanded the Captain, sternly.
“This is my house; and, although it’s all that my
friends have left to me,” he added, bitterly, “I’m
still the master under my own roof. Sit down,
Perkins, sit down, Sam, my lad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden tenderness that crept into the last
words seemed to rouse the woman to fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the boy that robbed you!” she cried,
pointing at me a trembling, bony finger. “That’s
the boy that skinned the house of all your valeybles
and treasures as soon as he thought you was
dead, and couldn’t come back to punish him! An’
stole all my savins’ too; and swore he’d be a pirate
and murder and steal all his life; an’ that
the man,” turning fiercely upon my horrified
uncle, “as aided an’ abetted him in his wickedness,
an’ threatened to kill me if I interfered
with Sam’s carryin’ away of your property! Cap’n
Steele, how dare you harbor sich varmints? Drive
’em out, this instant, or I’ll go myself. This house
can’t hold Sam Steele, the robber, and me at the
same time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Steele looked toward me gravely as
I stood regarding the woman with unmistakable
amazement. Then he turned to Naboth Perkins,
to find the little man doubled up in his chair and
shaking with silent laughter. A moment later he
began to gasp and choke and cough, until, just as
he appeared to be on the verge of convulsions, he
suddenly straightened up and wiped the tears from
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cap’n Steele, sir,” he said, “this is the best
show I ever had a reserved seat at, an’ the admission’s
free gratis for nothin’! Why, you measly
old she-tiger,” turning with stern abruptness to
Mrs. Ranck, “did you ever think, fer a minute,
that such a lyin’ tale as you’ve trumped up would
deceive grown men?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ranck turned away and caught her shawl from
a peg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll go,” she said, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you don’t!” exclaimed Mr. Perkins,
bounding between her and the door of her room,
toward which she was hastening; “you’ll stay
right here till this mystery is cleared up. For, if
I understand Cap’n Steele aright, he can’t find the
property he left in this house, ner imagine what’s
become of it; an’ you’ve been stuffing him with
lies about Sam’s running away with it. Am I
right, Cap’n?”</p>

<p class='c009'>My father nodded, gazing with lowering brow
upon the cowed and trembling form of the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Cap’n’s property an’ his savin’s didn’t
walk away by themselves,” continued Uncle Naboth,
“and no one could ’a’ took ’em except Sam
or this woman. Very good. They’re both here,
now, an’ you’re going to clear up the mystery and
get your money back, Cap’n, before you takes
your eye off’n either one. Just flop into that
chair, Mrs. Ranck, an’ if you try to wiggle away
I’ll call the police!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman obeyed. A dull glaze had come
over her eyes, and her features were white and set.
In all her cunning plotting she had never imagined
that I or my uncle would ever return to Batteraft
to confound her. She believed that the
knowledge that I was in her debt would prevent
my coming back, in any event, and she fully expected
me to be buffeted here and there about the
world, with never a chance of my being again
heard of in my old home.</p>

<p class='c009'>What a mistake she had made! But it was all
owing to this little fat man whom she had driven
thoughtlessly from her door the day that I was
sent away into exile. She had never heard of
Naboth Perkins before; nor did she know, any
more than I myself did at the time, of the partnership
formerly existing between the two men,
or even the fact of their relationship. She felt
that she was caught in a trap, in some unexpected
way, and the disaster stunned her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Steele filled and lighted his pipe before
the silence of the little group was again broken.
Then, turning to me, he asked:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why did you believe I was dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One of your sailors brought the news, sir, and
told us of the wreck. He gave Mrs. Ranck
your watch and ring, which he believed were taken
from your dead body.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a lie!” snapped the woman, desperately.
“I never seen the watch and ring; but he said the
Cap’n was dead, all right, an’ that’s why Sam run away
with the property.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was the sailor?” enquired my father,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ned Britton, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye, an honest, worthy lad, who sailed with
me for years. And he had the watch and ring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir. Ned was taken with a fever when
he escaped from the wreck, and after he recovered
they told him that several bodies had been washed
ashore and buried by the villagers. On one of the
bodies they found the watch and ring, so Ned
naturally thought you had perished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the ship broke up,” said Captain
Steele, slowly, “and I knew the end had come,
I sent one of my lads to my cabin to get my
trinkets while I attended to lowering the boats.
I never saw him again. For my part, my leg was
crushed by a falling mast, but I got entangled in
the rigging and the mast floated me to a little
island where a dozen fisher-folks lived. One was
a bit of a doctor, and cut away my mangled leg
and nursed me back to life. While I waited for
a ship to touch the island I regained my strength
and made myself a new leg out of cotton-wood.
Then, one day, a schooner carried me to Plymouth,
and the Captain, who was a kindly man,
loaned me enough money to bring me to Batteraft
where I thought I’d find my savings; enough to
buy a new ship and start business again. But
Mrs. Ranck met me with the news that my son
had stripped the house of all my valuables and run
away with a man that was known to be a pirate.
My room was quite bare, I found, and Mrs.
Ranck claimed she had hardly enough left of her
savings to buy food with. So here I was, a cripple
and condemned to poverty after a successful
career; and it’s no wonder my thoughts were bitter
towards my son, whom I never would have believed
could act so ungratefully. My only comfort
was that Sam had believed me dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth nodded approval.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite proper, sir,” he said, “an’ all quite
right and shipshape. Sam didn’t take a penny’s
worth from this house; but I made him my partner,
in your place, and we’ve had a successful
voyage and come back rich as Croessuses. You’ll
live in clover, from this time on, Cap’n Steele,
even if you never get back the property Mrs.
Ranck has robbed you of. But why not make her
give it up? She can’t have squandered it on
riotous living, by the looks of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Steele turned to the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What have you to say, Mrs. Ranck?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s all a pack o’ lies,” she snarled, “but there’s
no call for you to believe me if you don’t want to.
One thing’s certain, though. This is my house,
an’ the deed of it’s in my name. You’ll have to
clear out o’ here, all three of you, or I’ll have the
law on you an’ put you out!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Steele arose calmly and seized the
woman by her arms. In spite of her screams and
struggles he carried her to his own little room and
thrust her in, locking the door safely upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said he, “let’s explore the place and
see what we can find. I’ve never been in Mrs.
Ranck’s room, for until today I had no suspicions
of her. Come with me. If she’s honest we shall
find nothing, for she can’t have disposed of the
property.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right you are, sir,” cried Uncle Naboth,
springing up; and we all three at once proceeded
to enter the room the housekeeper had for so
many years reserved for her own use.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was simply and plainly furnished, and a
single glance served to convince us that it contained
no evidence whatever of the missing property.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strange!” said my father, musingly. “There
were nine cases and three chests, besides the
great sea-chest that I found still in my room, although
emptied of all its contents. Whatever
could have become of them all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dad,” I exclaimed, suddenly, “I remember
there used to be a sort of cellar under this room,
that could only be reached by a trap-door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True,” replied my father; “I remember that,
too. But where is the trap?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Naboth was already making a careful
inspection of the old rag carpet that covered the
floor. In one corner the tacks seemed far apart
and scanty. He seized the carpet and jerked it
away from the fastenings, disclosing a small
square trap with an iron ring in the center.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s the treasure house, sir,” he announced
triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get a candle, Sam,” said my father, gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>When it was brought, all three of us descended
the narrow stairs to the underground room,
where the cases and chests were speedily found,
all stored in orderly fashion against the walls.
The contents of the great sea chest, which she
had doubtless removed before admitting me to
the Captain’s room, had been placed in boxes
which Mrs. Ranck had secured from the grocery
store. In addition to Captain Steele’s property,
there was also a brass kettle almost full of gold
and silver coins, which the miserly old woman
had saved from the money my father had given
her to clothe and care for me, as well as to defray
the household expenses while the sailor was
away upon his voyages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps her own wages were added to this
store, as well; anyway, Captain Steele seemed to
think so. For, after assuring himself that all his
missing property was safe, he carried the kettle
up to the living room and proceeded to liberate
Mrs. Ranck. When, scowling but subdued, she
crept from the little room, my father offered to
give to her the entire contents of the kettle if she
would freely transfer to him the deed to the
house, and quit Batteraft for good and all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Its more than you deserve,” said he, “but I
don’t want to go to the police in this matter unless
you force me to. Take the money and go,
and never let me see your face in Batteraft again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course she accepted the generous proposition.
After gathering her few clothes into a bundle,
she took her treasure and left the house. The
first train that left Batteraft carried her with it,
and I have never seen her since.</p>

<p class='c009'>I acknowledge that I watched her go with a
lighter and happier heart than I had known for
months.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was in this way that she once drove me
from my old home, father,” I said. “But it can’t
be such a bad world, after all. For, if the wicked
sometimes appear to triumph, they are usually
punished in the end, and now that Mrs. Ranck
has passed out of our lives we ought to be very
happy again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will be, Sam!” returned my father,
earnestly, as he affectionately pressed my hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hooray!” yelled Uncle Naboth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c004'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />STEELE, PERKINS AND STEELE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'>Captain Steele was extremely grateful to
Uncle Naboth for his care of me, and was delighted
by the relation of our adventures on the
golden island, as well as pardonably proud of the
financial success we had attained.</p>

<p class='c009'>A new firm was created under the title of
“Steele, Perkins and Steele,” and a new ship was
soon found that seemed to have been especially
constructed to meet our requirements. Captain
Steele, declaring that his wooden leg would in no
way interfere with his usefulness, decided to
command the ship himself, and Ned Britton was
made first mate. Uncle Naboth and I were appointed
to look after all the finances and attend to
the trading at the various ports, and Nux and
Bryonia were brought from San Francisco and
given posts on the new ship, to their great delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the advice of his shrewder brother-in-law
my father converted all his accumulated treasures
into money, which was safely invested in
Government bonds that were deposited in a Boston
bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whatever happens now,” observed Uncle
Naboth, “nobody can’t rob you again; and if our
business ventures proves unsuccessful, and Sam
and I go bankrupt, you’ve always got something
to fall back on in your old age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But success seemed to follow in the wake of
the new firm, and the “Cleopatra,” as our ship
is named, has made voyage after voyage with
unvarying good fortune.</p>
